<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">There seems no reason to me why I should write a
preface to my brother’s book except that I have been,
as it were, a herald of war proclaiming the achievements
of knights and men-at-arms in this great conflict that
has passed, and so may take up my scroll again on his
behalf, because here is a good soldier who has told, in a
good book, his story of</p>

<p class="noindent pad2">“most disastrous chances of moving accidents
by flood and field; of hair-breadth ’scapes i’ the
imminent-deadly breach.”</p>

<p>That he was a good soldier I can say not because
my judgment is swayed by brotherly partiality, but
because I saw him at his job, and heard the opinions
of his fellow officers, which were immensely in his favour.
“Your brother is a born soldier,” said my own Chief
who was himself a gallant officer and had a quick eye
for character. I think that was true. The boy whom
once I wheeled in a go-cart when he was a shock-headed
Peter and I the elder brother with a sense of responsibility
towards him, had grown up before the war into a strong
man whose physical prowess as an amateur pugilist,
golfer, archer (in any old sport) was quite outside my
sphere of activities, which were restricted to watching
the world spin round and recording its movements by
quick penmanship. Then the war came and like all the
elder brothers of England I had a quick kind of heart-beat
when I knew that the kid brother had joined up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
in due time would have to face the music being played
by the great orchestra of death across the fields of life.</p>

<p>I saw the war before he did, knew the worst before
he guessed at the lesser evils of it, heard the crash of
shell fire, went into burning and bombarded towns,
helped to carry dead and wounded, while he was training
in England under foul-mouthed sergeants&mdash;training to
learn how to fight, and, if need be, how to die, like a little
gentleman. But I from the first was only the onlooker,
the recorder, and he was to be, very quickly, one of the
actors in the drama, up to his neck in the “real thing.”
His point of view was to be quite different from mine,
I saw the war in the mass, in its broad aspects and movements
from the front line trenches to the Base, from one
end of the front to the other. I went into dirty places,
but did not stay there. I went from one little corner
of hell to another, but did not dwell in its narrow boundaries
long enough to get its intimate details of hellishness
burnt into my body and soul. He did. He had not the
same broad vision of the business of war&mdash;appalling in
its vastness of sacrifice and suffering, wonderful in its
mass-heroism&mdash;but was one little ant in a particular
muck-heap for a long period of time, until the stench
of it, the filth of it, the boredom of it, the futility of
it, entered into his very being, and was part of him
as he was part of it. His was the greater knowledge.
He was the sufferer, the victim. Our ways lay apart
for a long time. He became a ghost to me, during his
long spell in Salonica, and I thought of him only as a
ghost figure belonging to that other life of mine which
I had known “before the war,” that far-off period of
peace which seemed to have gone forever. Then one
day I came across him again out in Flanders in a field
near Armentières, and saw how he had hardened and
grown, not only in years, but in thoughtfulness and know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>ledge.
He was a commander of men, with the power of
life and death over them. He was a commander of guns
with the power of death over human creatures lurking
in holes in the earth, invisible creatures beyond a hedge
of barbed wire and a line of trench. But he also was
under the discipline of other powers with higher command
than his&mdash;who called to him on the telephone and told
him to do things he hated to do, but had to do, things
which he thought were wrong to do, but had to do; and
among those other powers, disciplining his body and soul,
was German gun-power from that other side of the
barbed-wire hedge, always a menace to him, always
teasing him with the chance of death,&mdash;a yard this way,
a yard that, as I could see by the shell holes round about
his gun pits, following the track of his field-path, clustering
in groups outside the little white house in which he had
his mess. I studied this brother of mine curiously.
How did he face all the nerve-strain under which I had
seen many men break? He was merry and bright
(except for sudden silences and a dark look in his eyes
at times). He had his old banjo with him and tinkled
out a tune on it. How did he handle his men and junior
officers? They seemed to like him “this side idolatry,”
yet he had a grip on them, and demanded obedience, which
they gave with respect. Queer! My kid-brother had
learned the trick of command. He had an iron hand
under a velvet glove. The line of his jaw, his straight
nose (made straighter by that boxing in his old Oxford
days) were cut out for a job like this. He looked the
part. He was born to it. All his training had led up to
this soldier’s job in the field, though I had not guessed
so when I wheeled him in that old go-cart.</p>

<p>For me he had a slight contempt, which he will deny
when he reads this preface. Though a writer of books
before the war, he had now the soldier’s scorn of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
chronicler. It hurt him to see my green arm-band,
my badge of shame. That I had a motor-car seemed
to him, in his stationary exile, the sign of a soft job&mdash;as,
compared with his, it was&mdash;disgraceful in its luxury.
From time to time I saw him, and, in spite of many
narrow escapes under heavy shelling, he did not change,
but was splendidly cheerful. Even on the eve of the
great German offensive in March of 1918, when he took
me to see his guns dug in under the embankment
south of St. Quentin, he did not seem apprehensive of the
awful ordeal ahead of him. I knew more than he did
about that. I knew the time and place of its coming,
and I knew that he was in a very perilous position.
We said “so long” to each other at parting, with a grip
of hands, and I thought it might be the last time I should
see him. It was I think ten days later when I saw him,
and in that time much had happened, and all that time
I gave him up as lost. Under the overwhelming weight
of numbers&mdash;114 Divisions to 48&mdash;the British line
had broken, and fighting desperately, day by day,
our men fell back mile after mile with the enemy outflanking
them, cutting off broken battalions, threatening
to cut off vast bodies of men. Every day I was in the
swirl of that Retreat, pushing up to its rearguards, seeing
with increasing dismay the fearful wreckage of our
organization and machine of war which became for a
little while like the broken springs of a watch, with
Army, Corps, and Divisional staffs, entirely out of touch
with the fighting units owing to the break-down of all
lines of communication. In that tide of traffic, of men,
and guns, and transport, I made a few inquiries about
that brother of mine. Nobody had seen, or heard of his
battery. I must have been close to him at times in
Noyon, and Guiscard and Ham, but one individual
was like a needle in a bunch of hay, and the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
had rolled over in a tide, and there did not seem to
me a chance of his escape. Then, one morning, in a
village near Poix, when I asked a gunner-officer whether
he had seen my brother’s battery, he said, “Yes&mdash;two
villages up that road.” “Do you happen to know
Major Gibbs?” “Yes.... I saw him walking along
there a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>It was like hearing that the dead had risen from
the grave.</p>

<p>Half an hour later we came face to face.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>“Hulloa, old man!”</p>

<p>And I said:</p>

<p>“Hulloa, young fellow!”</p>

<p>Then we shook hands on it, and he told me some
of his adventures, and I marvelled at him, because
after a wash and shave he looked as though he had
just come from a holiday at Brighton instead of from
the Valley of Death. He was as bright as ever, and
I honestly believe even now that in spite of all his danger
and suffering, he had enjoyed the horrible thrills of
his adventures. It was only later when his guns were
in action near Albert that I saw a change in him. The
constant shelling, and the death of some of his officers
and men, had begun to tell on him at last. I saw that
his nerve was on the edge of snapping, as other men’s
nerves had snapped after less than his experiences, and
I decided to rescue him by any means I could.... I
had the luck to get him out of that hole in the earth
just before the ending of the war.</p>

<p>Now I have read his book. It is a real book. Here
truthfully, nakedly, vividly, is the experience not only
of one soldier in the British Army, but of thousands,
and hundreds of thousands. All our men went through
the training he describes, were shaped by its hardness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
and its roughness, were trampled into obedience of soul
and body by its heavy discipline. Here is the boredom
of war, as well as its thrill of horror, that devastating
long-drawn Boredom which is the characteristic of war
and the cause of much of its suffering. Here is the sense
of futility which sinks into the soldier’s mind, tends
to sap his mental strength and embitters him, so that
the edge is taken off his enthusiasm, and he abandons
the fervour of the ideal with which he volunteered.</p>

<p>There is a tragic bitterness in the book, and that
is not peculiar to the temperament of the author, but a
general feeling to be found among masses of demobilized
officers and men, not only of the British Armies, but of
the French, and I fancy, also, of the American forces.
What is the cause of that? Why this spirit of revolt
on the part of men who fought with invincible courage
and long patience? It will seem strange to people
who have only seen war from afar that an officer like
this, decorated for valour, early in the field, one of the
old stock and tradition of English loyalty, should utter
such fierce words about the leaders of the war, such ironical
words about the purpose and sacrifice of the world
conflict. He seems to accuse other enemies than the
Germans, to turn round upon Allied statesmen, philosophers,
preachers, mobs and say, “You too were guilty
of this fearful thing. Your hands are red also with
the blood of youth. And you forget already those who
saved you by their sacrifice.”</p>

<p>That is what he says, clearly, in many passionate
paragraphs; and I can bear witness that his point
of view is shared by many other soldiers who fought
in France. These men were thinking hard when day
by day they were close to death. In their dug-outs
and ditches they asked of their own souls enormous
questions. They asked whether the war was being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
fought really for Liberty, really to crush Militarism,
really on behalf of Democracy, or whether to bolster
up the same system on our side of the lines which had
produced the evils of the German menace. Was it not a
conflict between rival Powers imbued with exactly
the same philosophy of Imperialism and Force? Was
it not the product of commercial greed, diplomatic
fears and treacheries and intrigues (conducted secretly
over the heads of the peoples) and had not the German
people been led on to their villainy by the same spell-words
and “dope” which had been put over our peoples,
so that the watch-words of “patriotism,” “defensive
warfare” and “Justice” had been used to justify this
massacre in the fields of Europe by the Old Men of all
nations, who used the Boys as pawns in their Devil’s
game? The whole structure of Europe had been wrong.
The ministers of the Christian churches had failed Christ
by supporting the philosophy of Force, and diplomatic
wickedness and old traditions of hatred. All nations
were involved in this hark-back to the jungle-world,
and Germany was only most guilty because first to
throw off the mask, most efficient in the mechanism of
Brute-government, most logical in the damnable laws of
that philosophy which poisoned the spirit of the modern
world.</p>

<p>That was the conclusion to which, rightly or wrongly&mdash;I
think rightly&mdash;many men arrived in their secret
conferences with their own souls when death stood near
the door of their dug-outs.</p>

<p>That sense of having fought for ideals which were
not real in the purpose of the war embittered them;
and they were most bitter on their home-coming, after
Armistice, or after Peace, when in England they found
that the victory they had won was being used not to
inaugurate a new era of liberty, but to strengthen the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
old laws of “Might and Right,” the old tyrannies of
government without the consent of peoples, the old
Fetish worship of hatred masking under the divine name
of Patriotism. Disillusionment, despair, a tragic rage,
filled the hearts of fighting men who after all their sacrifices
found themselves unrewarded, unemployed, and
unsatisfied in their souls. Out of this psychological
distress have come civil strife and much of the unrest
which is now at work.</p>

<p>My brother’s book reveals something of this at work
in his own mind, and, as such, is a revelation of all his
comrades. I do not think he has yet found the key to
the New Philosophy which will arise out of all that experience,
emotion, and thought; just as the mass of
fighting men are vague about the future which must
replace the bad old past. They are perplexed, illogical,
passionate without a clear purpose. But undoubtedly
out of their perplexities and passion the New Era will
be born.</p>

<p>So I salute my “kid-brother” as one of the makers
of History greater than that which crushed German
militarism and punished German crimes (which were
great), and I wish him luck with this book, which is
honest, vital, and revealing.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">In June, 1914, I came out of a hospital in Philadelphia
after an operation, faced with two facts. One was
that I needed a holiday at home in England, the second
that after all hospital expenses were paid I had five
dollars in the world. But there was a half-finished novel
in my trunk and the last weeks of the theatrical tour
which had brought me to Philadelphia would tide me over.
A month later the novel was bought by a magazine and
the boat that took me to England seemed to me to be
the tangible result of concentrated will power. “Man
proposes....” My own proposal was to return to
America in a month or six weeks to resume the task of
carving myself a niche in the fiction market.</p>

<p>The parting advice of the surgeon had been that I
was not to play ball or ride a horse for at least six months.
The green sweeping uplands of Buckinghamshire greeted
me with all their fragrance and a trig golf course gave
me back strength while I thought over ideas for a new
novel.</p>

<p>Then like a thunderbolt the word “War” crashed
out. Its full significance did not break through the
ego of one who so shortly would be leaving Europe
far behind and to whom a personal career seemed of
vital importance. England was at war. The Army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
would be buckling on its sword, running out its guns;
the Navy clearing decks for action. It was their job,
not mine. The Boer War had only touched upon my
childish consciousness as a shouting in the streets, cheering
multitudes and brass bands. War, as such, was
something which I had never considered as having any
personal meaning for me. Politics and war were the
business of politicians and soldiers. My business was
writing and I went up to London to arrange accommodations
on the boat to New York.</p>

<p>London was different in those hot August days.
Long queues waited all day,&mdash;not outside theatres,
but outside recruiting offices,&mdash;city men, tramps, brick-layers,
men of all types and ages with a look in their
eyes that puzzled me. Every taxi hoot drew one’s attention
to the flaring poster on each car, “Young Men of
England, Your King and Country need you!”</p>

<p>How many millions of young men there were who
would be glad to answer that call to adventure,&mdash;an
adventure which surely could not last more than six
months? It did not call me. My adventure lay in
that wonderland of sprouting towers that glistened
behind the Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>But day by day the grey wave swept on, tearing
down all veils from before the altar of reality. Belgian
women were not merely bayoneted.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we stop this? What is the Army doing?”
How easy to cry that out from the leafy lanes of Buckinghamshire.
A woman friend of mine travelled up in the
train with me one morning, a friend whose philosophy
and way of life had seemed to me more near the ideal
than I had dreamed of being able to reach. She spoke
of war, impersonally and without recruiting propaganda.
All unconsciously she opened my eyes to the unpleasant
fact that it was <em>my</em> war too. Suppose I had returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
to New York and the Germans had jumped the tiny
Channel and “bayoneted” her and her children? Could
I ever call myself a man again?</p>

<p>I took a taxi and went round London. Every recruiting
office looked like a four-hour wait. I was in a hurry.
So I went by train to Bedford and found it crowded
with Highlanders. When I asked the way to the recruiting
office they looked at me oddly. Their speech was
beyond my London ear, but a pointing series of arms
showed it to me.</p>

<p>By a miracle the place was empty except for the
doctor and an assistant in khaki.</p>

<p>“I want to join the Cavalry,” said I.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir. Will you please take off your
clothes.”</p>

<p>It was the last time a sergeant called me sir for many
a long day.</p>

<p>I stripped, was thumped and listened to and gave
description of tattoo marks which interested that
doctor greatly. The appendix scar didn’t seem to
strike him. “What is it?” said he, looking at it
curiously, and when I told him merely grunted. Shades
of Shaw! I thought with a jump of that Philadelphia
surgeon. “Don’t ride a horse for six months.” Only
three had elapsed.</p>

<p>I was passed fit. I assured them that I was English
on both sides, unmarried, not a spy, and was finally
given a bundle of papers and told to take them along to
the barracks.</p>

<p>The barracks were full of roughnecks and it occurred
to me for the first time, as I listened to them being sworn
in, that these were my future brother soldiers. What
price Mulvaney, Learoyd and Ortheris? thought I.</p>

<p>I repeated the oath after an hour’s waiting and swore
to obey orders and respect superior officers and in short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
do my damnedest to kill the King’s enemies. I’ve done
the last but when I think of the first two that oath makes
me smile.</p>

<p>However, I swore, received two shillings and three-pence
for my first two days’ pay and was ordered to
report at the Cavalry Depot, Woolwich, the following
day, September 3, 1914.</p>

<p>The whole business had been done in a rush of exaltation
that didn’t allow me to think. But when I stepped
out into the crowded streets with that two shillings rattling
in my pocket I felt a very sober man. I knew nothing
whatever of soldiering. I hardly even knew a corporal
from a private or a rifle from a ramrod, and here I was
Trooper A. H. Gibbs, 9th Lancers, with the sullen rumble
of heavy guns just across the Channel&mdash;growing louder.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Woolwich!</p>

<p>Bad smells, bad beer, bad women, bad language!&mdash;Those
early days! None of us who went through
the ranks will ever forget the tragedy, the humour,
the real democracy of that period. The hand of time
has already coloured it with the glow of romance, but
in the living it was crude and raw, like waking up to
find your nightmare real.</p>

<p>Oxford University doesn’t give one much of an idea
of how to cope with the class of humanity at that Depot
in spite of Ruskin Hall, the working-man’s college, of
which my knowledge consisted only of climbing over
their wall and endeavouring to break up their happy home.
But the Ruskin Hall man was a prince by the side of those
recruits. They came with their shirts sticking out of
trousers seats, naked toes showing out of gaping boots,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and their smell&mdash;&mdash; We lay at night side by side on
adjoining bunks, fifty of us in a room. They had spent
their two days’ pay on beer, bad beer. The weather was
hot. Most of them were stark naked. I’d had a bath
that morning. They hadn’t.</p>

<p>The room was enormous. The windows had no
blinds. The moon streamed in on their distorted bodies
in all the twistings of uneasy sleep. Some of them
smoked cigarettes and talked. Others blasphemed them
for talking, but the bulk snored and ground their teeth
in their sleep.</p>

<p>A bugle rang out.</p>

<p>Aching in every limb from the unaccustomed hardness
of the iron bed it was no hardship to answer the call.
There were lavatories outside each room and amid much
sleepy blasphemy we shaved, those of us who had razors,
and washed, and in the chill of dawn went down to a
misty common. It was too early for discipline. There
weren’t enough N.C.O.’s, so for the first few days we
hung about waiting for breakfast instead of doing physical
jerks.</p>

<p>Breakfast! One thinks of a warm room with cereals
and coffee and eggs and bacon with a morning paper and,
if there’s a soot in our cup, a sarcastic reference as to
cleanliness. That was before the war.</p>

<p>We lined up before the door of a gun shed, hundreds
of us, shivering, filing slowly in one by one and having
a chunk of bread, a mug of tea and a tin of sardines
slammed into our hands, the sardines having to be divided
among four.</p>

<p>The only man in my four who possessed a jack-knife
to open the tin had cleaned his pipe with it, scraped the
mud off his boots, cleaned out his nails and cut up plug
tobacco. Handy things, jack-knives. He proceeded to
hack open the tin and scoop out sardines. It was only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
my first morning and my stomach wasn’t strong in those
days. I disappeared into the mist, alone with my dry
bread and tea. Hunger has taught me much since then.</p>

<p>The mist rolled up later and daylight showed us to
be a pretty tough crowd. We were presently taken
in hand by a lot of sergeants who divided us into groups,
made lists of names and began to teach us how to march
in the files, and in sections,&mdash;the elements of soldiering.
Some of them didn’t seem to know their left foot from
their right, but the patience of those sergeants was only
equalled by the cunning of their blasphemy and the
stolidity of their victims.</p>

<p>After an hour of it we were given a rest for fifteen
minutes, this time to get a handful of tobacco. Then
it went on again and again,&mdash;and yet again.</p>

<p>The whole of that first period of seven days was a
long jumble of appalling happenings; meals served
by scrofulitic hands on plates from which five other
men’s leavings and grease had to be removed; bread
cut in quarter loaves; meat fat, greasy, and stewed&mdash;always
stewed, tea, stewed also, without appreciable
milk, so strong that a spoon stood up in it unaided;
sleeping in one’s clothes and inadequate washing in that
atmosphere of filth indescribable; of parades to me
childish in their elementariness; of long hours in the
evening with nothing to do, no place to go, no man to
talk to,&mdash;a period of absolute isolation in the middle of
those thousands broken only by letters which assumed
a paramount importance, constituting as they did one’s
only link with all that one had left behind, that other life
which now seemed like a mirage.</p>

<p>Not that one regretted the step. It was a first-hand
experience of life that only Jack London or Masefield
could have depicted. It was too the means of getting
out to fight the Boche. A monotonous means, yes, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
every day one learnt some new drill and every day one
was thrilled with the absolute cold-blooded reality of it
all. It was good to be alive, to be a man, to get one’s
teeth right into things. It was a bigger part to play than
that of the boy in “The Blindness of Virtue.”</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Two incidents stand out in that chrysalis stage of
becoming soldiers.</p>

<p>One was a sing-song, spontaneously started among
the gun sheds in the middle of the white moonlight.
One of the recruits was a man who had earned his living&mdash;hideously
sarcastic phrase!&mdash;by playing a banjo and
singing outside public houses. He brought his banjo
into the army with him. I hope he’s playing still!</p>

<p>He stuck his inverted hat on the ground, lit a candle
beside it in the middle of the huge square, smacked his
dry lips and drew the banjo out of its baize cover.</p>

<p>“Perishin’ thirsty weather, Bill.”</p>

<p>He volunteered the remark to me as to a brother.</p>

<p>“Going to play for a drink?” I asked.</p>

<p>He was already tuning. He then sat down on a
large stone and began to sing. His accompaniment
was generous and loud and perhaps once he had a voice.
It came now with but an echo of its probable charm,
through a coating of beer and tobacco and years of
rough living.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary. Just he sitting on the stone,
and I standing smoking by his side, and the candle
flickering in the breeze, and round us the hard black
and white buildings and the indefinable rumble of a
great life going on somewhere in the distance.</p>

<p>Presently, as though he were the Pied Piper, men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
came in twos and threes and stood round us, forming
a circle.</p>

<p>“Give us the ‘Little Grey ’Ome in the West,’ George!”</p>

<p>And “George,” spitting after the prolonged sentiment
of Thora, struck up the required song. At the
end of half an hour there were several hundred men
gathered round joining in the choruses, volunteering
solos, applauding each item generously. The musician
had five bottles of beer round his inverted hat and perhaps
three inside him, and a collection of coppers was taken
up from time to time.</p>

<p>They chose love ballads of an ultra-sentimental nature
with the soft pedal on the sad parts,&mdash;these men who
to-morrow would face certain death. How little did
that thought come to them then. But I looked round
at their faces, blandly happy, dirty faces, transformed
by the moon and by their oath of service into the faces
of crusaders.</p>

<p>How many of them are alive to-day, how many buried
in nameless mounds somewhere in that silent desolation?
How many of them have suffered mutilation? How
many of them have come out of it untouched, to the
waiting arms of their women? Brothers, I salute you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other incident was the finding of a friend, a
kindred spirit in those thousands which accentuated
one’s solitude.</p>

<p>We had been standing in a long queue outside the
Quartermaster’s store, being issued with khaki one
by one. I was within a hundred yards of getting outfitted
when the Q.M. came to the door in person and
yelled that the supply had run out. I think we all
swore. The getting of khaki meant a vital step nearer
to the Great Day when we should cross the Channel.
As the crowd broke away in disorder, I heard a voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
with an ‘h’ say “How perfectly ruddy!” I could have
fallen on the man’s neck with joy. The owner of it was
a comic sight. A very battered straw hat, a dirty handkerchief
doing the duty of collar, a pair of grey flannel trousers
that had been slept in these many nights. But the
face was clear and there was a twinkle of humorous
appreciation in the blue eye. I made a bee-line for that
man. I don’t remember what I said, but in a few minutes
we were swapping names, and where we lived and what we
thought of it, and laughing at our mutually draggled
garments.</p>

<p>We both threw reserve to the wind and were most
un-English, except perhaps that we may have looked
upon each other as the only two white men in a tribe
of savages. In a sense we were. But it was like finding
a brother and made all that difference to our immediate
lives. There was so much pent-up feeling in both of
us that we hadn’t been able to put into words. Never
have I realized the value and comfort of speech so much,
or the bond established by sharing experiences and
emotions.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>My new-found “brother’s” name was Bucks. After
a few more days of drilling and marching and sergeant
grilling, we both got khaki and spurs and cap badges
and bandoliers, and we both bought white lanyards
and cleaning appliances. Smart? We made a point
of being the smartest recruits of the whole bunch. We
felt we were the complete soldier at last and although
there wasn’t a horse in Woolwich we clattered about in
spurs that we burnished to the glint of silver.</p>

<p>And then began the second chapter of our military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
career. We all paraded one morning and were told
off to go to Tidworth or the Curragh.</p>

<p>Bucks and I were for Tidworth and marched side
by side in the great squad of us who tramped in step,
singing “Tipperary” at the top of our lungs, down to
the railway station.</p>

<p>That was the first day I saw an officer, two officers
as a matter of fact, subalterns of our own regiment.
It gave one for the first time the feeling of belonging
to a regiment. In the depot at Woolwich were 9th
Lancers, 5th Dragoon Guards, and 16th Lancers. Now
we were going to the 9th Lancer barracks and those two
subalterns typified the regiment to Bucks and me. How
we eyed them, those two youngsters, and were rather
proud of the aloof way in which they carried themselves.
They were specialists. We were novices beginning at
the bottom of the ladder and I wouldn’t have changed
places with them at that moment had it been possible.
As an officer I shouldn’t have known what to do with
the mob of which I was one. I should have been awkward,
embarrassed.</p>

<p>It didn’t occur to me then that there were hundreds,
thousands, who knew as little as we did about the Army,
who were learning to be second lieutenants as we were
learning to be troopers.</p>

<p>We stayed all day in that train, feeding on cheese
and bread which had been given out wrapped in newspapers,
and buns and biscuits bought in a rush at railway
junctions at which we stopped from time to time.
It was dark when we got to Tidworth, that end-of-the-world
siding, and were paraded on the platform and
marched into barracks whose thousand windows winked
cheerily at us as we halted outside the guardroom.</p>

<p>There were many important people like sergeant-majors
waiting for us, and sergeants who called them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
“sir” and doubled to carry out their orders. These
latter fell upon us and in a very short time we were
divided into small groups and marched away to barrack
rooms for the night. There was smartness here, discipline.
The chaos of Woolwich was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Already I pictured myself being promoted to lance-corporal,
the proud bearer of one stripe, picking Boches
on my lance like a row of pigs,&mdash;and I hadn’t even handled
a real lance as yet!</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Tidworth, that little cluster of barrack buildings on
the edge of the sweeping downs, golden in the early
autumn, full of a lonely beauty like a green Sahara with
springs and woods, but never a house for miles, and no
sound but the sighing of the wind and the mew of the
peewit! Thus I came to know it first. Later the rain
turned it into a sodden stretch of mud, blurred and
terrible, like a drunken street-woman blown by the wind,
filling the soul with shudders and despair.&mdash;The barrack
buildings covered perhaps a square mile of ground,
ranged orderly in series, officers’ quarters&mdash;as far removed
from Bucks and me as the Carlton Hotel&mdash;married
quarters, sergeants’ mess, stables, canteen, riding school,
barrack rooms, hospital; like a small city, thriving and
busy, dropped from the blue upon that patch of country.</p>

<p>The N.C.O.’s at Tidworth were regulars, time-serving
men who had learnt their job in India and who looked
upon us as a lot of “perishin’ amatoors.” It was a very
natural point of view. We presented an ungodly sight,
a few of us in khaki, some in “blues,” those terrible
garments that make their wearers look like an orphan’s
home, but most in civilian garments of the most tattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
description. Khaki gave one standing, self-respect,
cleanliness, enabled one to face an officer feeling that one
was trying at least to be a soldier.</p>

<p>The barrack rooms were long and whitewashed, a stove
in the middle, rows of iron beds down either side to take
twenty men in peace times. As it was we late comers
slept on “biscuits,” square hard mattresses, laid down
between the iron bunks, and mustered nearly forty in
a room. In charge of each room was a lance-corporal
or corporal whose job it was to detail a room orderly and
to see furthermore that he did his job, <em>i.e.</em>, keep the room
swept and garnished, the lavatory basins washed, the
fireplace blackleaded, the windows cleaned, the step
swept and whitewashed.</p>

<p>Over each bed was a locker (without a lock, of course)
where each man kept his small kit,&mdash;razor, towel, toothbrush,
blacking and his personal treasures. Those who
had no bed had no locker and left things beneath the
folded blankets of the beds.</p>

<p>How one missed one’s household goods! One learnt
to live like a snail, with everything in the world upon
one’s person,&mdash;everything in the world cut down to the
barest necessities, pipe and baccy, letters, a photograph,
knife, fork and spoon, toothbrush, bit of soap, tooth paste,
one towel, one extra pair of socks. Have you ever tried
it for six months&mdash;a year? Then don’t. You miss
your books and pictures, the bowl of flowers on the table,
the tablecloth. All the things of everyday life that are
taken for granted become a matter of poignant loss
when you’ve got to do without them. But it’s marvellous
what can be done without when it’s a matter of
necessity.</p>

<p>Bucks unfortunately didn’t get to the same room
with me. All of us who had come in the night before
were paraded at nine o’clock next morning before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Colonel and those who had seen service or who could
ride were considered sheep and separated from the goats
who had never seen service nor a horse. Bucks was a
goat. I could ride,&mdash;although the sergeant-major took
fifteen sulphuric minutes to tell me he didn’t think so.
And so Bucks and I were separated by the space of a
barrack wall, as we thought then. It was a greater
separation really, for he was still learning to ride when
I went out to France to reinforce the fighting regiment
which had covered itself with glory in the retreat from
Mons. But before that day came we worked through
to the soul of Tidworth, and of the sergeant-major,
if by any stretch of the imagination he may be said to
have had a soul. I think he had, but all the other men
in the squadron dedicated their first bullet to him if they
saw him in France. What a man! He stands out
among all my memories of those marvellous days of
training when everything was different from anything
I had ever done before. He stands before me now,
a long, thin figure in khaki, with a face that had been
kicked in by a horse, an eye that burnt like a branding
iron, and picked out unpolished buttons like a magnet.
In the saddle he was a centaur, part of the horse, wonderful.
His long, thin thighs gripped like tentacles of
steel. He could make an animal grunt, he gripped so
hard. And his language! Never in my life had I conceived
the possibilities of blasphemy to shrivel a man’s
soul until I heard that sergeant-major. He ripped the
Bible from cover to cover. He defied thunderbolts
from on high and referred to the Almighty as though
he were a scullion,&mdash;and he’s still doing it. Compared
to the wholesale murder of eight million men it was
undoubtedly a pin-prick, but it taught us how to ride!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Reveille was at 5.30.</p>

<p>Grunts, groans, curses, a kick,&mdash;and you were sleepily
struggling with your riding breeches and puttees.</p>

<p>The morning bath? Left behind with all the other
things.</p>

<p>There were horses to be groomed and watered and
fed, stables to be “mucked out,” much hard and muscular
work to be done before that pint of tea and slab of grease
called bacon would keep body and soul together for the
morning parade. One fed first and shaved and splashed
one’s face, neck, and arms with water afterwards. Have
you ever cleaned out a stable with your bare hands and
then been compelled to eat a meal without washing?</p>

<p>By nine o’clock one paraded with cleaned boots,
polished buttons and burnished spurs and was inspected
by the sergeant-major. If you were sick you went before
the doctor instead. But it didn’t pay to be sick. The
sergeant-major cured you first. Then as there weren’t
very many horses in barracks as yet, we were divided
half into the riding school, half for lance and sword
drill.</p>

<p>Riding school was invented by the Spanish Inquisition.
Generally it lasted an hour, by which time one
was broken on the rack and emerged shaken, bruised and
hot, blistered by the sergeant-major’s tongue. There
were men who’d never been on a horse more than twice
in their lives, but most of us had swung a leg over a saddle.
Many in that ride were grooms from training stables,
riders of steeple-chasers. But their methods were not
at all those desired in His Majesty’s Cavalry and they
suffered like the rest of us. But the sergeant-major’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
tongue never stopped and we either learned the essentials
in double-quick time or got out to a more elementary
ride.</p>

<p>It was a case of the survival of the fittest. Round
and round that huge school, trotting with and without
stirrups until one almost fell off from sheer agony, with
and without saddle over five-foot jumps pursued by the
hissing lash of the sergeant-major’s tongue and whip,
jumping without reins, saddle or stirrups. The agony
of sitting down for days afterwards!</p>

<p>Followed a fifteen-minute break, after the horses
were led back to the stables and off-saddled, and then
parade on the square with lance and sword. A lovely
weapon the lance&mdash;slender, irresistible&mdash;but after an
hour’s concentrated drill one’s right wrist became red-hot
and swollen and the extended lance points drooped
in our tired grasp like reeds in the wind. At night
in the barrack room we used to have competitions to see
who could drive the point deepest into the door panels.</p>

<p>Then at eleven o’clock “stables” again: caps and
tunics off, braces down, sleeves rolled up. We had a
magnificent stamp of horse, but they came in ungroomed
for days and under my inexpert methods of grooming
took several days before they looked as if they’d been
groomed at all.</p>

<p>Dinner was at one o’clock and by the time that hour
struck one was ready to eat anything. Each squadron
had its own dining-rooms, concrete places with wooden
tables and benches, but the eternal stew went down
like caviar.</p>

<p>The afternoon parades were marching drill, physical
exercises, harness cleaning, afternoon stables and finish
for the day about five o’clock, unless one were wanted
for guard or picquet. Picquet meant the care of the
horses at night, an unenviable job. But guard was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
twenty-four hours’ duty, two hours on, four hours off,
much coveted after a rough passage in the riding school.
It gave one a chance to heal.</p>

<p>Hitherto everything had been a confused mass of
men without individuality but of unflagging cheerfulness.
Now in the team work of the squadron and the barrack
room individuality began to play its part and under the
hard and fast routine the cheerfulness began to yield
to grousing.</p>

<p>The room corporal of my room was a re-enlisted
man, a schoolmaster from Scotland, conscientious, liked
by the men, extremely simple. I’ve often wondered
whether he obtained a commission. The other troopers
were ex-stable boys, labourers, one a golf caddy and one
an ex-sailor who was always singing an interminable
song about a highly immoral donkey. The caddy and
the sailor slept on either side of me. They were a mixed
crowd and used filthy language as naturally as they
breathed, but as cheery and stout a lot as you’d wish
to meet. Under their grey shirts beat hearts as kindly
as many a woman’s. I remember the first time I was
inoculated and felt like nothing on earth.</p>

<p>“Christ!” said the sailor. “Has that perishin’
doctor been stickin’ his perishin’ needle into you, Mr.
Gibbs?”&mdash;For some reason they always called me
Mr. Gibbs.&mdash;“Come over here and get straight to bed
before the perishin’ stuff starts workin’. I’ve ’ad some
of it in the perishin’ navy.” And he and the caddy took
off my boots and clothes and put me to bed with gentle
hands.</p>

<p>The evening’s noisiness was given up. Everybody
spoke in undertones so that I might get to sleep. And
in the morning, instead of sweeping under my own bed
as usual, they did it for me and cleaned my buttons and
boots because my arm was still sore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>Can you imagine men like that nailing a kitten by its
paws to a door as a booby-trap to blow a building sky
high, as those Boches have done? Instead of bayoneting
prisoners the sailor looked at them and said, “Ah, you
poor perishin’ tikes!” and threw them his last cigarettes.</p>

<p>They taught me a lot, those men. Their extraordinary
acceptation of unpleasant conditions, their
quickness to resent injustice and speak of it at once,
their continual cheeriness, always ready to sing, gave me
something to compete with. On wet days of misery
when I’d had no letters from home there were moments
when I damned the war and thought with infinite regret
of New York. But if these fellows could stick it, well,
I’d had more advantages than they’d had and, by Jove,
I was going to stick it too. It was a matter of personal
pride.</p>

<p>Practically they taught me many things as well.
It was there that they had the advantage of me. They
knew how to wash shirts and socks and do all the menial
work which I had never done. I had to learn. They
knew how to dodge “fatigues” by removing themselves
just one half-minute before the sergeant came looking
for victims. It didn’t take me long to learn that.</p>

<p>Then one saw gradually the social habit emerge, called
“mucking in.” Two men became pals and paired off,
sharing tobacco and pay and saddle soap and so on.
For a time I “mucked in” with Sailor&mdash;he was always
called Sailor&mdash;and perforce learned the song about the
Rabelaisian donkey. I’ve forgotten it now. Perhaps
it’s just as well. Then when the squadron was divided
up into troops Sailor and I were not in the same troop
and I had to muck in with an ex-groom. He was the
only man who did not use filthy language.</p>

<p>It’s odd about that language habit. While in the
ranks I never caught it, perhaps because I considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
myself a bit above that sort of thing. It was so childish
and unsatisfying. But since I have been an officer I
think I could sometimes have almost challenged the
sergeant-major!</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>As soon as one had settled into the routine the days
began to roll by with a monotony that was, had we only
known it, the beginning of knowledge. Some genius
has defined war as “months of intense boredom punctuated
by moments of intense fear.” We had reached
the first stage. It was when the day’s work was done
that the devil stalked into one’s soul and began asking
insidious questions. The work itself was hard, healthy,
of real enjoyment. Shall I ever forget those golden
autumn dawns when I rode out, a snorting horse under
me, upon the swelling downs, the uplands touched by
the rising sun; but in the hollows the feathery tops
of trees poked up through the mist which lay in velvety
clouds and everywhere a filigree of silver cobwebs, like
strung seed pearls. It was with the spirit of crusaders
that we galloped cross-country with slung lances, or
charged in line upon an imaginary foe with yells that
would demoralise him before our lance points should
sink into his fat stomach. The good smells of earth and
saddlery and horse flesh, the lance points winking in the
sun, were all the outward signs of great romance and one
took a deep breath of the keen air and thanked God
to be in it. One charged dummies with sword and lance
and hacked and stabbed them to bits. One leaped from
one’s horse at the canter and lined a bank with rifles
while the numbers three in each section galloped the
horses to a flank under cover. One went over the brigade
jumps in troop formation, taking pride in riding so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
all horses jumped as one, a magnificent bit of team work
that gave one a thrill.</p>

<p>It was on one of those early morning rides that Sailor
earned undying fame. Remember that all of the work
was done on empty stomachs before breakfast and
that if we came back late, a frequent occurrence, we
received only scraps and a curse from the cook. On the
morning in question the sergeant-major ordered the whole
troop to unbuckle their stirrup leathers and drop them
on the ground. We did so.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “we’re going to do a brisk little
cross-country follow-my-leader. I’m the leader and”
(a slight pause with a flash from the steely eye), “God help
the weak-backed, herring-gutted sons of &mdash;&mdash; who don’t
perishin’ well line up when I give the order to halt. Half
sections right! walk, march!”</p>

<p>We walked out of the barracks until we reached the
edge of the downs and then followed such a ride as John
Gilpin or the Baron Munchausen would have revelled
in&mdash;perhaps. The sergeant-major’s horse could jump
anything, and what it couldn’t jump it climbed over.
It knew better than to refuse. We were indifferently
mounted, some well, some badly. My own was a good
speedy bay. The orders were to keep in half sections&mdash;two
and two. For a straight half-mile we thundered
across the level, drew rein slightly through a thick copse
that lashed one’s face with pine branches and then
dropped over a precipice twenty feet deep. That was
where the half-section business went to pieces, especially
when the horses clambered up the other side. We
had no stirrups. It was a case of remaining in the saddle
somehow. Had I been alone I would have ridden five
miles to avoid the places the sergeant-major took us over,
through, and under,&mdash;bramble hedges that tore one’s
clothes and hands, ditches that one had to ride one’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
horse at with both spurs, banks so steep that one almost
expected the horse to come over backwards, spinneys
where one had to lie down to avoid being swept off.
At last, breathless, aching and exhausted, those of us
who were left were halted and dismounted, while the
sergeant-major, who hadn’t turned a hair, took note
of who was missing.</p>

<p>Five unfortunates had not come in. The sergeant-major
cast an eye towards the open country and remained
ominously silent. After about a quarter of an hour
the five were seen to emerge at a walk from behind a
spinney. They came trotting up, an anxious expression
on their faces, all except Sailor, who grinned from ear to
ear. Instead of being allowed to fall in with us they were
made to halt and dismount by themselves, facing us. The
sergeant-major looked at them, slowly, with an infinite contempt,
as they stood stiffly to attention. Then he began.</p>

<p>“Look at them!” he said to us. “Look at those
five....” and so on in a stinging stream, beneath which
their faces went white with anger.</p>

<p>As the sergeant-major drew breath, Sailor stepped
forward. He was no longer grinning from ear to ear.
His face might have been cut out of stone and he looked
at the sergeant-major with a steady eye.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Sergeant-Major,” he said. “We’re
all that and a perishin’ lot more perhaps, but not you nor
Jesus Christ is going to make me do a perishin’ ride
like that and come back to perishin’ barracks and get
no perishin’ breakfast and go on perishin’ parade again
at nine with not a perishin’ thing in my perishin’ stomach.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>“What I says,” said Sailor, standing to his guns
while we, amazed, expected him to be slain before our
eyes. “Not a perishin’ bit of breakfast do we get when
we go back late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“Is that true?” The sergeant-major turned to us.</p>

<p>“Yes,” we said, “perishin’ true!”</p>

<p>“Mount!” ordered the sergeant-major without another
word and we trotted straight back to barracks. By
the time we’d watered, off-saddled and fed the horses
we were as usual twenty minutes late for breakfast. But
this morning the sergeant-major, with a face like a black
cloud, marched us into the dining-hall and up to the
cook’s table.</p>

<p>We waited, breathless with excitement. The cook
was in the kitchen, a dirty fellow.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major slammed the table with his whip.
The cook came, wiping a chewing mouth with the back
of his hand.</p>

<p>“Breakfast for these men, quick,” said the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>“All gone, sir,” said the cook, “we can’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sergeant-major leaned over with his face an
inch from the cook’s. “Don’t you perishin’ well answer
me back,” he said, “or I’ll put you somewhere where
the Almighty couldn’t get you out until I say so. Breakfast
for these men, you fat, chewing swine, or I’ll come
across the table and cut your tripes out with my riding
whip and cook <em>them</em> for breakfast! Jump, you foul-feeder!”
and down came the whip on the table like a
pistol shot.</p>

<p>The cook swallowed his mouthful whole and retired,
emerging presently with plenty of excellent breakfast
and hot tea. We laughed.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the sergeant-major, “if you don’t get
as good a breakfast as this to-morrow and every to-morrow,
tell me, and I’ll drop this lying bastard into his
own grease trap.”</p>

<p>Sailor got drunk that night. We paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>The evenings were the hardest part. There was
only Bucks to talk to, and it was never more than twice
a week that we managed to get together. Generally
one was more completely alone than on a desert island,
a solitude accentuated by the fact that as soon as one
ceased the communion of work which made us all brothers
on the same level, they dropped back, for me at least,
into a seething mass of rather unclean humanity whose
ideas were not mine, whose language and habits never
ceased to jar upon one’s sensitiveness. There was so
little to do. The local music hall, intensely fifth rate,
only changed its programme once a week. The billiard
tables in the canteen had an hour-long waiting list always.</p>

<p>The Y.M.C.A. hadn’t developed in those early days
to its present manifold excellence. There was no gymnasium.
The only place one had was one’s bed in the
barrack room on which one could read or write, not alone,
because there was always a shouting incoming and
outgoing crowd and cross fire of elementary jokes and
horseplay. It seemed that there was never a chance
of being alone, of escaping from this “lewd and licentious
soldiery.” There were times when the desert island
called irresistibly in this eternal isolation of mind but not
of body. All that one had left behind, even the times
when one was bored and out of temper, because perhaps
one was off one’s drive at the Royal and Ancient, or
some other trivial thing like that, became so glorious
in one’s mind that the feel of the barrack blanket was an
agony. Had one <em>ever</em> been bored in that other life?
Had one been touchy and said sarcastic things that
were meant to hurt? Could it be possible that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
was anything in that other world for which one wouldn’t
barter one’s soul now? How little one had realised,
appreciated, the good things of that life! One accepted
them as a matter of course, as a matter of right.</p>

<p>Now in the barrack-room introspections their real
value stood out in the limelight of contrast and one saw
oneself for the first time: a rather selfish, indifferent
person, thoughtless, hurrying along the road of life with
no point of view of one’s own, doing things because
everybody else did them, accepting help carelessly, not
realising that other people might need one’s help in
return, content with a somewhat shallow secondhand
philosophy because untried in the fire of reality. This
was reality, this barrack life. This was the first time
one had been up against facts, the first time it was a
personal conflict between life and oneself with no mother
or family to fend off the unpleasant; a fact that one
hadn’t attempted to grasp.</p>

<p>The picture of oneself was not comforting. To find
out the truth about oneself is always like taking a pill
without its sugar coating; and it was doubly bitter in
those surroundings.</p>

<p>Hitherto one had never been forced to do the unpleasant.
One simply avoided it. Now one had to go
on doing it day after day without a hope of escape,
without any more alleviation than a very occasional
week-end leave. Those week-ends were like a mouthful
of water to Dives in the flames of hell,&mdash;but which made
the flames all the fiercer afterwards! One prayed for
them and loathed them.</p>

<p>The beating heart with which one leaped out of a
taxi in London and waited on the doorstep of home,
heaven. The glory of a clean body and more particularly,
clean hands. It was curious how the lack of a bath
ceased after a time to be a dreadful thing, but the im<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>possibility
of keeping one’s hands clean was always a
poignant agony. They were always dirty, with cracked
nails and a cut or two, and however many times they
were scrubbed, they remained appalling. But at home
on leave, with hot water and stacks of soap and much
manicuring, they did not at least make one feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The soft voices and laughter of one’s people, their
appearance&mdash;just to be in the same room, silent with
emotion&mdash;God, will one ever forget it? Thin china
to eat off, a flower on the table, soft lights, a napkin.&mdash;The
little ones who came and fingered one’s bandolier
and cap badge and played with one’s spurs with their
tiny, clean hands&mdash;one was almost afraid to touch them,
and when they puckered up their tiny mouths to kiss
one good night.&mdash;I wonder whether they ever knew
how near to tears that rough-looking soldier-man was?</p>

<p>And then in what seemed ten heart-beats one was
saying good-bye to them all. Back to barracks again
by way of Waterloo and the last train at 9 p.m.&mdash;its
great yellow lights and awful din, its surging crowd of
drunken soldiers and their girls who yelled and hugged
and screamed up and down the platform, and here and
there an officer diving hurriedly into a first-class compartment.
Presently whistles blew and one found oneself
jammed into a carriage with about twelve other soldiers
who fought to lean out of the window and see the last of
their girls until the train had panted its way out of the
long platform. Then the foul reek of Woodbine cigarettes
while they discussed the sexual charms of those
girls&mdash;and then a long snoring chorus for hours into
the night, broken only by some one being sick from overmuch
beer.</p>

<p>The touch of the rosebud mouth of the baby girl who
had kissed me good-bye was still on my lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>It was in the first week of November that, having
been through an exhaustive musketry course in addition
to all the other cavalry work, we were “passed out” by
the Colonel. I may mention in passing that in October,
1914, the British Cavalry were armed, for the first time
in history, with bayonets in addition to lance, sword and
rifle. There was much sarcastic reference to “towies,”
“foot-sloggers,” “P.B.I.”&mdash;all methods of the mounted
man to designate infantry; and when an infantry sergeant
was lent to teach us bayonet fighting it seemed the
last insult, even to us recruits, so deeply was the cavalry
spirit already ingrained in us.</p>

<p>The “passing out” by the Colonel was a day in our
lives. It meant that, if successful, we were considered
good enough to go and fight for our country: France was
the Mecca of each of us.</p>

<p>The day in question was bright and sunny with a touch
of frost which made the horses blow and dance when,
with twinkling lance-points at the carry, we rode out with
the sergeant-major, every bright part of our equipment
polished for hours overnight in the barrack room amid
much excited speculation as to our prospects.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major was going to give us a half-hour’s
final rehearsal of all our training before the Colonel
arrived. Nothing went right and he damned and cursed
without avail, until at last he threatened to ride us clean
off the plain and lose us. It was very depressing. We
knew we’d done badly, in spite of all our efforts, and when
we saw, not far off, the Colonel, the Major and the Adjutant,
with a group of other people riding up to put us
through our paces, there wasn’t a heart that didn’t beat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
faster in hope or despair. We sat to attention like Indians
while the officers rode round us, inspecting the turnout.</p>

<p>Then the Colonel expressed the desire to see a little
troop drill.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major cleared his throat and like an
18-pounder shell the order galvanised us into action. We
wheeled and formed and spread out and reformed without
a hitch and came to a halt in perfect dressing in front of
the Colonel again, without a fault. Hope revived in
despairing chests.</p>

<p>Then the Colonel ordered us over the jumps in half
sections, and at the order each half section started away
on the half-mile course&mdash;walk, trot, canter, jump, steady
down to trot, canter, jump&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">e da capo</i> right round about
a dozen jumps, each one over a different kind of obstacle,
each half section watched far more critically perhaps by
the rest of the troop than by the officers. My own
mount was a bay mare which I’d ridden half a dozen
times. When she liked she could jump anything. Sometimes
she didn’t like.</p>

<p>This day I was taking no chances and drove home both
spurs at the first jump. My other half section was a
lance-corporal. His horse was slow, preferring to
consider each jump before it took it.</p>

<p>Between jumps, without moving our heads and looking
straight in front of us, we gave each other advice and
encouragement.</p>

<p>Said he, “Not so perishin’ fast. Keep dressed, can’t
you.”</p>

<p>Said I, “Wake your old blighter up! What’ve you
got spurs on for?&mdash;Hup! Over. Steady, man, steady.”</p>

<p>Said he, “Nar, then, like as we are. Knee to knee.
Let’s show ’em what the perishin’ Kitchener’s mob
perishin’ well <em>can</em> do.” And without a refusal we got
round and halted in our places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>When we’d all been round, the Colonel with a faint
smile on his face, requested the sergeant-major to take
us round as a troop&mdash;sixteen lancers knee to knee in the
front rank and the same number behind.</p>

<p>It happened that I was the centre of the front rank&mdash;technically
known as centre guide&mdash;whose job it was to
keep four yards from the tail of the troop leader and on
whom the rest of the front rank “dressed.”</p>

<p>When we were well away from the officers and about
to canter at the first jump the sergeant-major’s head
turned over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>you</em>’re centre guide, Gibbs, are you! Well,
you keep your distance proper, that’s all, and by Christ,
if you refuse&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>I don’t know what fate he had in store for me had I
missed a jump but there I was with a knee on either
side jammed painfully hard against mine as we came to
the first jump. It was the man on either flank of the
troop who had the most difficult job. The jumps were
only just wide enough and they had to keep their horses
from swinging wide of the wings. It went magnificently.
Sixteen horses as one in both ranks rose to every jump,
settled down and dressed after each and went round the
course without a hitch, refusal or fall, and at last we sat at
attention facing the Colonel, awaiting the verdict which
would either send us back for further training, or out to&mdash;what?
Death, glory, or maiming?</p>

<p>The Major looked pleased and twisted his moustache
with a grin. He had handled our squadron and on the
first occasion of his leading us in a charge, he in front
with drawn sword, we thundering behind with lances
menacing his back in a glittering row, we got so excited
that we broke ranks and flowed round him, yelling like
cowboys. How he damned us!</p>

<p>The Colonel made a little speech and complimented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
us on our work and the sergeant-major for having trained
us so well,&mdash;us, the first of Kitchener’s “mob” to be
ready. Very nice things he said and our hearts glowed
with appreciation and excitement. We sat there without
a movement but our chests puffed out like a row of pouter
pigeons.</p>

<p>At last he saluted us&mdash;saluted <em>us</em>, he, the Colonel&mdash;and
the officers rode away,&mdash;the Major hanging behind
a little to say with a smile that was worth all the cursings
the sergeant-major had ever given us, “Damn good, you
fellows! <em>Damn</em> good!” We would have followed him
to hell and back at that moment.</p>

<p>And then the sergeant-major turned his horse and faced
us. “You may <em>think</em> you’re perishin’ good soldiers after
all that, but by Christ, I’ve never seen such a perishin’
awful exhibition of carpet-baggers.”</p>

<p>But there was an unusual twinkle in his eye and for
the first time in those two months of training he let us
“march at ease,” <em>i.e.</em>, smoke and talk, on the way back
to stables.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>That was the first half of the ordeal.</p>

<p>The second half took place in the afternoon in the
barrack square when we went through lance drill and
bayonet exercises while the Colonel and the officers
walked round and discussed us. At last we were dismissed,
trained men, recruits no longer; and didn’t we
throw our chests out in the canteen that night! It made
me feel that the Nobel prize was futile beside the satisfaction
of being a fully trained trooper in His Majesty’s
Cavalry, and in a crack regiment too, which had already
shown the Boche that the “contemptible little army”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
had more “guts” than the Prussian Guards regiments
and anything else they liked to chuck in.</p>

<p>I foregathered with Bucks that night and told him all
about it. Our ways had seemed to lie apart during those
intensive days, and it was only on Sundays that we sometimes
went for long cross-country walks with biscuits and
apples in our pockets if we were off duty. About once
a week too we made a point of going to the local music-hall
where red-nosed comedians knocked each other
about and fat ladies in tights sang slushy love songs;
and with the crowd we yelled choruses and ate vast
quantities of chocolate.</p>

<p>Two other things occurred during those days which
had an enormous influence on me; one indeed altered my
whole career in the army.</p>

<p>The first occurrence was the arrival in a car one evening
of an American girl whom I’d known in New York. It
was about a week after my arrival at Tidworth. She, it
appeared, was staying with friends about twenty miles
away.</p>

<p>The first thing I knew about it was when an orderly
came into stables about 4.30 p.m. on a golden afternoon
and told me that I was wanted at once at the Orderly
Room.</p>

<p>“What for?” said I, a little nervous.</p>

<p>The Orderly Room was where all the scallawags were
brought up before the Colonel for their various crimes,&mdash;and
I made a hasty examination of conscience.</p>

<p>However, I put on my braces and tunic and ran across
the square. There in a car was the American girl whom
I had endeavoured to teach golf in the days immediately
previous to my enlistment. “Come on out and have a
picnic with me,” said she. “I’ve got some perfectly
luscious things in a basket.”</p>

<p>The idea was heavenly but it occurred to me I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
ought to get permission. So I went into the Orderly
Room.</p>

<p>There were two officers and a lot of sergeants. I
tiptoed up to a sergeant and explaining that a lady had
come over to see me, asked if I could get out of camp for
half an hour? I was very raw in those days,&mdash;half an
hour!</p>

<p>The sergeant stared at me. Presumably ladies in
motor-cars didn’t make a habit of fetching cavalry
privates. It wasn’t “laid down” in the drill book.
However, he went over to one of the officers,&mdash;the
Adjutant, I discovered later.</p>

<p>The Adjutant looked me up and down as I repeated my
request, asked me my name and which ride I was in and
finally put it to the other officer who said “yes” without
looking up. So I thanked the Adjutant, clicked to the
salute and went out. As I walked round the front of
the car, while the chauffeur cranked up, the door of the
Orderly Room opened and the Adjutant came on to the
step. He took a good look at the American girl and said,
“Oh&mdash;er&mdash;Gibbs! You can make it an hour if you
like.”</p>

<p>It may amuse him to know, if the slaughter hasn’t
claimed him, that I made it exactly sixty minutes, much
as I should have liked to make it several hours, and was
immensely grateful to him both for the extra half hour
and for the delightful touch of humour.</p>

<p>What a picnic it was! We motored away from that
place and all its roughness and took the basket under a
spinney in the afternoon sun which touched everything
in a red glow.</p>

<p>It wasn’t only tea she gave me, but sixty precious
minutes of great friendship, letting fall little remarks
which helped me to go back all the more determined to
stick to it. She renewed my faith in myself and gave me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
renewed courage,&mdash;for which I was unable to thank her.
We British are so accursedly tongue-tied in these matters.
I did try but of course made a botch of it.</p>

<p>There are some things which speech cannot deal with.
Your taking me out that day, oh, American girl, and the
other days later, are numbered among them.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>The other occurrence was also brought about by a
woman, <em>the</em> woman for whom I joined up. It was a
Sunday morning on which fortunately I was not detailed
for any fatigues and she came to take me out to lunch.
We motored to Marlborough, lunched at the hotel and
after visiting a racing stable some distance off came
back to the hotel for tea, a happy day unflecked by any
shadow. In the corner of the dining-room were two
officers with two ladies. I, in the bandolier and spurs of
a trooper, sat with my back to them and my friend told
me that they seemed to be eyeing me and making
remarks. It occurred to me that as I had no official
permission to be away from Tidworth they might possibly
be going to make trouble. How little I knew what was
in their minds. When we’d finished and got up to go
one of the officers came across as we were going out of
the room and said, “May I speak to you a moment?”</p>

<p>We both stopped. “I see you’re wearing the numerals
of my regiment,” said he and went on to ask why I was
in the ranks, why I hadn’t asked for a commission, and
strongly advised me to do so.</p>

<p>I told him that I hadn’t ever thought of it because I
knew nothing about soldiering and hadn’t the faintest
idea of whether I should ever be any good as an officer.
He waved that aside and advised me to apply. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
added that he himself was going out to France one day in
the following week and would I like to go as his servant?
Would I? My whole idea was to get to France; and this
happened before I had been passed out by the Colonel.
So he took down my name and particulars and said he
would ask for me when he came to Tidworth, which he
proposed to do in two days’ time.</p>

<p>Whether he ever came or not I do not know. I never
saw him again. Nor did I take any steps with regard to
a commission. My friend and I talked it over and I
remember rather laughing at the idea of it.</p>

<p>Not so she, however. About a fortnight later I was
suddenly sent for by the Colonel.</p>

<p>“I hear you’ve applied for a commission,” said he.</p>

<p>It came like a bolt from the blue. But through my
brain flashed the meeting in the Marlborough Hotel and
I saw in it the handiwork of my friend.</p>

<p>So I said, “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>He then asked me where I was educated and whether I
spoke French and what my job was in civil life and finally
I was sent off to fill up a form and then to be medically
examined.</p>

<p>And there the matter ended. I went on with the daily
routine, was passed out by the Colonel and a very few
days after that heard the glorious news that we were going
out as a draft to France on active service.</p>

<p>We were all in bed in the barrack room one evening
when the door opened and a sergeant came in and flicked
on the electric light, which had only just been turned
out.</p>

<p>“Wake up, you bloodthirsty warriors,” he cried.
“Wake up. You’re for a draft to-morrow all of you on
this list,” and he read out the names of all of us in the
room who had been passed out. “Parade at the Quartermaster’s
stores at nine o’clock in the morning.” And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
out went the light and the door slammed and a burst of
cheering went up.</p>

<p>And while I lay on my “biscuits,” imagining France
and hearing in my mind the thunder of guns and wondering
what our first charge would be like, the machinery which
my friend had set in motion was rolling slowly (shades of
the War Office!) but surely. My name had been submerged
in the “usual channels” but was receiving first
aid, all unknown to me, of a most vigorous description.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>Shall I <em>ever</em> forget that week-end, with all its strength
of emotions running the gamut from exaltation to blank
despair and back again to the wildest enthusiasm?</p>

<p>We paraded at the Quartermaster’s stores and received
each a kit bag, two identity discs&mdash;the subject of many
gruesome comments&mdash;a jack-knife, mess tin, water bottle,
haversack, and underclothes. Thus were we prepared
for the killing.</p>

<p>Then the Major appeared and we fell in before him.</p>

<p>“Now which of you men want to go to the front?”
said he. “Any man who wants to, take one pace forward.”</p>

<p>As one man the whole lot of us, about thirty, took one
pace forward.</p>

<p>The Major smiled. “Good,” said he. “Any man
<em>not</em> want to go&mdash;prove.”</p>

<p>No man proved.</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” said the Major, “I hate to disappoint
anybody but only twenty-eight of you can go.
You’ll have to draw lots.”</p>

<p>Accordingly bits of paper were put into a hat, thirty
scraps of paper, two of them marked with crosses. Was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
it a sort of inverted omen that the two who drew the
crosses would never find themselves under little mounds
in France?</p>

<p>We drew in turn, excitement running high as paper
after paper came out blank. My heart kicked within me.
How I prayed not to draw a cross. But I did!</p>

<p>Speechless with despair the other man who drew a
cross and I received the good-natured chaff of the rest.</p>

<p>I saw them going out, to leave this accursed place of
boredom and make-believe, for the real thing, the thing
for which we had slaved and sweated and suffered. We
two were to be left. We weren’t to go on sharing the luck
with these excellent fellows united to us by the bonds of
fellow-striving, whom we knew in sickness and health,
drunk and sober.</p>

<p>We had to remain behind, eating our hearts out to wait
for the next draft&mdash;a lot of men whom we did not know,
strangers with their own jokes and habits&mdash;possibly a
fortnight of hanging about. The day was a Friday and
our pals were supposed to be going at any moment. The
other unlucky man and myself came to the conclusion
that consolation might be found in a long week-end leave
and that if we struck while the iron of sympathy was hot
the Major might be inclined to lend a friendly ear. This
indeed he did and within an hour we were in the London
train on that gloomy Friday morning, free as any civilian
till midnight of the following Tuesday. Thus the Major’s
generosity. The only proviso was that we had both to
leave telegraphic addresses in case&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But in spite of that glorious week-end in front of us,
we refused to be consoled, yet, and insisted on telling the
other occupants of the carriage of our rotten luck. We
revelled in gloom and extraneous sympathy until Waterloo
showed up in the murk ahead. Then I’m bound to confess
my own mental barometer went up with a jump and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
said good-bye to my fellow lancer, who was off to pursue
the light o’ love in Stepney, with an impromptu Te Deum
in my heart.</p>

<p>My brother, with whom I spent all my week-ends in
those days, had a house just off the Park. He put in his
time looking like a rather tired admiral, most of whose
nights were passed looking for Zeppelins and yearning
for them to come within range of his beloved “bundooks”
which were in the neighbourhood of the Admiralty.
Thither I went at full speed in a taxi&mdash;they still existed
in those days&mdash;and proceeded to wallow in a hot bath,
borrowing my brother’s bath salts (or were they his
wife’s?), clean “undies” and hair juice with a liberal
hand. It was a comic sight to see us out together in the
crowded London streets, he all over gold lace, me just a
Tommy with a cheap swagger stick under my arm.
Subalterns, new to the game, saluted him punctiliously.
I saluted them. And when we met generals or a real
admiral we both saluted together. The next afternoon,
Saturday, at tea time a telegram came. We were deep
in armchairs in front of a gorgeous fire, with muffins sitting
in the hearth and softly shaded electric lights throwing
a glow over pictures and backs of books and the piano
which, after the barrack room, made us as near heaven as
I’ve ever been. The telegram was for me, signed by the
Adjutant.</p>

<p>“Return immediately.”</p>

<p>It was the echo of a far-off boot and saddle.&mdash;I took
another look round the room. Should I ever see it
again? My brother’s eye met mine and we rose together.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be getting along,” said I. “Cheero,
old son.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come with you to the station,” said he.</p>

<p>I shook my head. “No, please don’t bother.&mdash;Don’t
forget to write.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“Rather not.&mdash;Good luck, old man.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>We went down to his front door. I put on my bandolier
and picked up my haversack.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;so long.”</p>

<p>We shook hands.</p>

<p>“God bless you.”</p>

<p>I think we said it together and then the door closed
softly behind me.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Partir, c’est mourir un peu.&mdash;Un peu.</i>&mdash;God!</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>The next day, Sunday, we all hung about in a sort of
uneasy waiting, without any orders.</p>

<p>It gave us all time to write letters home. If I rightly
remember, absolute secrecy was to be maintained so we
were unable even to hint at our departure or to say good-bye.
It was probably just as well but they were difficult
letters to achieve. So we tied one identity disc to our
braces and slung the other round our necks on a string
and did rather more smoking than usual.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, all was bustle. The orders
had come in and we paraded in full fighting kit in front
of the guardroom.</p>

<p>The Colonel came on parade and in a silence that was
only broken by the beating of our hearts told us we were
going out to face the Boche for our King and Country’s
sake, to take our places in the ranks of a very gallant
regiment, and he wished us luck.</p>

<p>We gave three rather emotional cheers and marched
away with our chins high, followed by the cheers of the
whole barracks who had turned out to see us off. Just
as we were about to entrain the Major trotted up on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
big charger and shook us individually by the hand and
said he wished he were coming with us. His coming was
a great compliment and every man of us appreciated it
to the full.</p>

<p>The harbour was a wonderful sight when we got in
late that afternoon. Hundreds of arc lights lit up
numbers of ships and at each ship was a body of troops
entraining,&mdash;English, Scotch and Irish, cavalry, gunners
and infantry. At first glance it appeared a hopeless
tangle, a babel of yelling men all getting into each other’s
way. But gradually the eye tuned itself up to the endless
kaleidoscope and one saw that absolute order prevailed.
Every single man was doing a job and the work never
ceased.</p>

<p>We were not taking horses and marched in the charge
of an officer right through the busy crowd and halted
alongside a boat which already seemed packed with
troops. But after a seemingly endless wait we were
marched on board and, dodging men stripped to the waist
who were washing in buckets, we climbed down iron
ladders into the bowels of the hold, were herded into a
corner and told to make ourselves comfortable. Tea
would be dished out in half an hour.</p>

<p>Holds are usually iron. This was. Furthermore it
had been recently red-leaded. Throw in a strong suggestion
of garlic and more than a hint of sea-sickness and
you get some idea of the perfume that greeted us, friendly-like.</p>

<p>The comments, entirely good-natured, were unprintable.
There were no bunks. We had one blanket each
and a greatcoat. My thoughts turned to the first-class
stateroom of the <i>Caronia</i> in which only four months
previously I had had no thought of war. The accepted
form of romance and the glamour of war have been altered.
There are no cheering crowds and fluttering handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
and brass bands. The new romance is the light of the
moon flickering on darkened ships that creep one after
the other through the mine barrier out into deep waters,
turning to silver the foam ripped by the bows, picking out
the white expressionless faces of silent thousands of
khaki-clad men lining the rail, following the will-o’-the-wisp
which beckoned to a strange land.</p>

<p>How many of them knew what they were going to fight
for? How many of them realized the <ins class="corr" id="tn-40" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'unforgetable hell'">
unforgettable hell</ins> they were to be engulfed in, the sacrifice which they so
readily made of youth, love, ambition, life itself&mdash;and to
what end? To give the lie to one man who wished to
alter the face of the world? To take the part of the
smaller country trampled and battered by the bully?
To save from destruction the greasy skins of dirty-minded
politicians, thinking financially or even imperially, but
staying at home?</p>

<p>God knows why most of us went.</p>

<p>But the sting of the Channel wind as we <ins class="corr" id="tn-40a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'set out faces'">
set our faces</ins> to the enemy drove all reason from the mind and filled
it with a mighty exultation. If Death were there to
meet us, well, it was all in the game.</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>We climbed up from the hold next morning to find
ourselves in Portsmouth harbour. The word submarines
ran about the decks. There we waited all day, and again
under cover of dark made our way out to open water,
reaching Havre about six o’clock next morning.</p>

<p>We were marched ashore in the afternoon and transferred
to another boat. Nobody knew our destination
and the wildest guesses were made. The new boat was
literally packed. There was no question of going down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
into a hold. We were lucky to get sufficient deck space
to lie down on, and just before getting under way, it
began to rain. There were some London Scottish at
our end of the deck who, finding that we had exhausted
our rations, shared theirs with us. There was no question
of sleeping. It was too cold and too uncomfortable.
So we sang. There must have been some two thousand
of us on board and all those above deck joined in choruses
of all the popular songs as they sat hunched up or lying
like rows of sardines in the rain. Dawn found us shivering,
passing little villages on either bank of the river as
we neared Rouen. The early-rising inhabitants waved
and their voices came across the water, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vivent les
Anglais! A bas les Boches!</i>” And the sun came out
as we waved out shaving brushes at them in reply. We
eventually landed in the old cathedral city and formed
up and marched away across the bridge, with everybody
cheering and throwing flowers until we came to La
Bruyère camp.</p>

<p>Hundreds of bell tents, thousands of horses, and mud
over the ankles! That was the first impression of the
camp. It wasn’t until we were divided off into tents
and had packed our equipment tight round the tent pole
that one had time to notice details.</p>

<p>We spent about nine days in La Bruyère camp and we
groomed horses from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, wet or
fine. The lines were endless and the mud eternal. It
became a nightmare, relieved only by the watering of the
horses. The water was about a kilometre and a half
distant. We mounted one horse and led two more each
and in an endless line splashed down belly-deep in mud
past the hospital where the slightly wounded leaned over
the rail and exchanged badinage. Sometimes the sisters
gave us cigarettes for which we called down blessings on
their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>It rained most of the time and we stood ankle-deep
all day in the lines, grooming and shovelling away mud.
But all the time jokes were hurled from man to man,
although the rain dripped down their faces and necks.
We slept, if I remember rightly, twenty men in a tent,
head outwards, feet to the pole piled on top of each other,&mdash;wet,
hot, aching. Oh, those feet, the feet of tired heroes,
but unwashed. And it was impossible to open the tent
flap because of the rain.&mdash;Fortunately it was cold those
nights and one smoked right up to the moment of falling
asleep. Only two per cent. of passes to visit the town
were allowed, but the camp was only barb-wired and
sentried on one side. The other side was open to the
pine woods and very pretty they were as we went cross-country
towards the village of St. Etienne from which a
tram-car ran into Rouen in about twenty minutes. The
military police posted at the entrance to the town either
didn’t know their job or were good fellows of Nelsonian
temperament, content to turn a blind eye. From later
experience I judge that the former was probably the case.
Be that as it may, several hundreds of us went in without
official permission nearly every night and, considering
all things, were most orderly. Almost the only man
I ever saw drunk was, paradoxically enough, a police
man. He tried to place my companion and myself under
arrest, but was so far gone that he couldn’t write down our
names and numbers and we got off. The hand of Fate
was distinctly in it for had I been brought up and crimed
for being loose in the town without leave it might have
counted against me when my commission was being
considered.</p>

<p>One evening, the night before we left for the front, we
went down for a bath, the last we should get for many a
day. On our way we paid a visit to the cathedral. It
was good to get out of the crowded streets into the vast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
gloom punctured by pin-points of candlelight, with only
faint footfalls and the squeak of a chair to disturb the
silence. For perhaps half an hour we knelt in front of the
high altar,&mdash;quite unconsciously the modern version of
that picture of a knight in armour kneeling, holding up
his sword as a cross before the altar. It is called the
Vigil, I believe. We made a little vigil in khaki and
bandoliers and left the cathedral with an extraordinary
confidence in the morrow. There was a baby being
baptised at the font. It was an odd thing seeing that
baby just as we passed out. It typified somewhat the
reason of our going forth to fight.</p>

<p>The bath was amusing. The doors were being closed
as we arrived, and I had just the time to stick my foot in
the crack, much to the annoyance of the attendant. I
blarneyed him in French and at last pushed into the hall
only to be greeted by a cry of indignation from the lady
in charge of the ticket office. She was young, however
and pretty, and, determined to get a bath, I played upon
her feelings to the extent of my vocabulary. At first she
was adamant. The baths were closed. I pointed out
that the next morning we were going to the front to fight
for France. She refused to believe it. I asked her if
she had a brother. She said she hadn’t. I congratulated
her on not being agonized by the possibilities of his
death from hour to hour. She smiled.</p>

<p>My heart leaped with hope and I reminded her that as
we were possibly going to die for her the least she could
do was to let us die clean. She looked me straight in the
eye. There was a twinkle in hers. “You will not die,”
she said. Somehow one doesn’t associate the selling of
bath tickets with the calling of prophet. But she combined
the two. And the bath was gloriously hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>


<h3>15</h3>

<p>That nine days at La Bruyère did not teach us very
much,&mdash;not even the realization of the vital necessity of
patience. We looked upon each day as wasted because
we weren’t up the line. Everywhere were preparations
of war but we yearned for the sound of guns. Even the
blue-clad figures who exchanged jokes with us over the
hospital railing conveyed nothing of the grim tragedy of
which we were only on the fringe. They were mostly
convalescent. It is only the shattered who are being
pulled back to life by a thread who make one curse the
war. We looked about like new boys in a school, interested
but knowing nothing of the workings, reading none
of the signs. This all bored us. We wanted the line
with all the persistence of the completely ignorant.</p>

<p>The morning after our bath we got it. There was
much bustle and running and cursing and finally we had
our saddles packed, and a day’s rations in our haversacks
and a double feed in the nose-bags.</p>

<p>The cavalry man in full marching order bears a strange
resemblance to a travelling ironmonger and rattles like
the banging of old tins. The small man has almost to
climb up the near foreleg of his horse, so impossible is
it to get a leg anywhere near the stirrup iron with all his
gear on. My own method was to stick the lance in the
ground by the butt, climb with infinite labour and
heavings into the saddle and come back for the lance when
arranged squarely on the horse.</p>

<p>Eventually everything was accomplished and we
were all in the saddle and were inspected to see that we
were complete in every detail. Then we rode out of that
muddy camp in sections&mdash;four abreast&mdash;and made our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
way down towards the station. It was a real touch of
old-time romance, that ride. The children ran shouting,
and people came out of the shops to wave their hands and
give us fruit and wish us luck, and the girls blew kisses,
and through the hubbub the clatter of our horses over the
cobbles and the jingle of stirrup striking stirrup made
music that stirred one’s blood.</p>

<p>There was a long train of cattle trucks waiting for us
at the station and into these we put our horses, eight to
each truck, fastened by their ropes from the head collar
to a ring in the roof. In the two-foot space between the
two lots of four horses facing each other were put the eight
saddles and blankets and a bale of hay.</p>

<p>Two men were detailed to stay with the horses in
each truck while the rest fell in and were marched away
to be distributed among the remaining empty trucks.
I didn’t altogether fancy the idea of looking after eight
frightened steeds in that two-foot alleyway, but before
I could fall in with the rest I was detailed by the sergeant.</p>

<p>That journey was a nightmare. My fellow stableman
was a brainless idiot who knew even less about the handling
of horses than I did.</p>

<p>The train pulled out in the growing dusk of a cold
November evening, the horses snorting and starting
at every jolt, at every signal and telegraph pole that we
passed. When they pawed with their front feet we,
sitting on the bale of hay, had to dodge with curses.
There was no sand or bedding and it was only the tightness
with which they were packed together that kept them
on their feet. Every light that flashed by drew frightened
snorts. We spent an hour standing among them,
saying soothing things and patting their necks. We
tried closing the sliding doors but at the end of five minutes
the heat splashed in great drops of moisture from the roof
and the smell was impossible. Eventually I broke the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
bale of hay and threw some of that down to give them a
footing.</p>

<p>There was a lamp in the corner of the truck. I told
the other fellow to light it. He said he had no matches.
So I produced mine and discovered that I had only six
left. We used five to find out that the lamp had neither
oil nor wick. We had just exhausted our vocabularies
over this when the train entered a tunnel. At no time
did the train move at more than eight miles an hour and
the tunnel seemed endless. A times I still dream of that
tunnel and wake up in a cold sweat.</p>

<p>As our truck entered great billows of smoke rushed into
it. The eight horses tried as one to rear up and crashed
their heads against the roof. The noise was deafening
and it was pitch dark. I felt for the door and slid it shut
while the horses blew and tugged at their ropes in a
blind panic. Then there was a heavy thud, followed by
a yell from the other man and a furious squealing.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” I shouted, holding on to the head
collar of the nearest beast.</p>

<p>“Christ!” came the answer. “There’s a ’orse down
and I’m jammed up against the door ’ere. Come and get
me out, for Christ’s sake.”</p>

<p>My heart was pumping wildly.</p>

<p>The smoke made one gasp and there was a furious
stamping and squealing and a weird sort of blowing gurgle
which I could not define.</p>

<p>Feeling around I reached the next horse’s head collar
and staggered over the pile of saddlery. As I leaned
forward to get to the third something whistled past my
face and I heard the sickening noise of a horse’s hoof
against another horse, followed by a squeal. I felt
blindly and touched a flank where a head should have
been. One of them had swung round and was standing
with his fore feet on the fallen horse and was lashing out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
with both hind feet, while my companion was jammed
against the wall of the truck by the fallen animal presumably.</p>

<p>And still that cursed tunnel did not come to an end.
I yelled again to see if he were all right and his fruity
reply convinced me that at least there was no damage
done. So I patted the kicker and squeezed in to his
head and tried to get him round. It was impossible to
get past, over or under, and the brute wouldn’t move.
There was nothing for it but to remain as we were until
out of the tunnel. And then I located the gurgle. It
was the fallen horse, tied up short by the head collar to
the roof, being steadily strangled. It was impossible to
cut the rope. A loose horse in that infernal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> was
worse than one dead&mdash;or at least choking. But I cursed
and pulled and heaved in my efforts to get him up.</p>

<p>By this time there was no air and one’s lungs seemed on
the point of bursting. The roof rained sweat upon our
faces and every moment I expected to get a horse’s hoof
in my face.</p>

<p>How I envied that fellow jammed against the truck.
At last we came out into the open again, and I slid back
the door, and shoved my head outside and gulped in the
fresh air. Then I untied the kicker and somehow, I
don’t know how, got him round into his proper position
and tied him up, with a handful of hay all round to steady
their nerves.</p>

<p>The other man was cursing blue blazes all this time,
but eventually I cut the rope of the fallen horse, and
after about three false starts he got on his feet again
and was retied. The man was not hurt. He had been
merely wedged. So we gave some more hay all round,
cursed a bit more to ease ourselves and then went to the
open door for air. A confused shouting from the next
truck reached us. After many yells we made out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
following, “Pass the word forward that the train’s on
fire.”</p>

<p>All the stories I’d ever heard of horses being burnt
alive raced through my brain in a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>We leaned to the truck in front and yelled. No
answer. The truck was shut.</p>

<p>“Climb on the roof,” said I, “and go forward.” The
other man obeyed and disappeared into the dark.</p>

<p>Minutes passed, during which I looked back and saw
a cloud of smoke coming out of a truck far along the
train.</p>

<p>Then a foot dropped over from the roof and my companion
climbed back.</p>

<p>“Better go yourself,” he said. “I carnt mike ’im
understand. He threw lumps of coal at me from the
perishin’ engine.”</p>

<p>So I climbed on to the roof of the swaying coach,
got my balance and walked forward till a yard-wide
jump to the next roof faced me in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Lord!” thought I, “if I didn’t know that other
lad had been here, I shouldn’t care about it. However&mdash;&mdash;”
I took a strong leap and landed, slipping to
my hands and knees.</p>

<p>There were six trucks between me and the engine
and the jumps varied in width. I got there all right
and screamed to the engine driver, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Incendie!&mdash;Incendie!</i>”</p>

<p>He paused in the act of throwing coal at me and I
screamed again. Apparently he caught it, for first
peering back along all the train, he dived at a lever and
the train screamed to a halt. I was mighty thankful.
I hadn’t looked forward to going back the way I came
and I climbed quickly down to the rails. A sort of
guard with a lantern and an official appearance climbed
out of a box of sorts and demanded to know what was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the matter, and when I told him, called to me to follow
and began doubling back along the track.</p>

<p>I followed. The train seemed about a mile long but
eventually we reached a truck, full of men and a rosy
glare, from which a column of smoke bellied out. The
guard flashed his lantern in.</p>

<p>The cursed thing wasn’t on fire at all. The men were
burning hay in a biscuit tin, singing merrily, just keeping
themselves warm.</p>

<p>I thought of the agony of those jumps in the dark
from roof to roof and laughed. But I got my own back.
They couldn’t see us in the dark, so in short snappy
sentences I ordered them to put the fire out immediately.
And they thought I was an officer and did so.</p>


<h3>16</h3>

<p>The rest of the night passed in an endeavour to get
to sleep in a sitting position on the bale of hay. From
time to time one dozed off, but it was too cold, and the
infernal horses would keep on pawing.</p>

<p>Never was a night so long and it wasn’t till eight
o’clock in the morning that we ran into Hazebrouck
and stopped. By this time we were so hungry that
food was imperative. On the station was a great pile of
rifles and bandoliers and equipment generally, all dirty
and rusty, and in a corner some infantry were doing
something round a fire.</p>

<p>“Got any tea, chum?” said I.</p>

<p>He nodded a Balaklava helmet.</p>

<p>We were on him in two leaps with extended dixies.
It saved our lives, that tea. We were chilled to the
bone and had only bully beef and biscuits, of course, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
I felt renewed courage surge through me with every
mouthful.</p>

<p>“What’s all that stuff?” I asked, pointing to the
heap of equipments.</p>

<p>“Dead men’s weapons,” said he, lighting a “gasper.”
Somehow it didn’t sound real. One couldn’t
picture all the men to whom that had belonged dead.
Nor did it give one anything of a shock. One just
accepted it as a fact without thinking, “I wonder whether
<em>my</em> rifle and sword will ever join that heap?” The idea
of my being <em>killed</em> was absurd, fantastic. Any of these
others, yes, but somehow not myself. Never at any
time have I felt anything but extreme confidence in the
fact&mdash;yes, fact&mdash;that I should come through, in all
probability, unwounded. I thought about it often but
always with the certainty that nothing would happen
to me.</p>

<p>I decided that <em>if</em> I were killed I should be most frightfully
angry! There were so many things to be done
with life, so much beauty to be found, so many ambitions
to be realized, that it was impossible that I should be
killed. All this dirt and discomfort was just a necessary
phase to the greater appreciation of everything.</p>

<p>I can’t explain it. Perhaps there isn’t any explanation.
But never at any time have I seen the shell or
bullet with my name on it,&mdash;as the saying goes. And
yet somehow that pile of broken gear filled one with a
sense of the pity of it all, the utter folly of civilization
which had got itself into such an unutterable mess that
blood-letting was the only way out.&mdash;I proceeded to
strip to the waist and shave out of a horse-bucket of
cold water.</p>

<p>There was a cold drizzle falling when at last we had
watered the horses, fed and saddled them up, and were
ready to mount. It increased to a steady downpour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
as we rode away in half sections and turned into a muddy
road lined with the eternal poplar. In the middle of
the day we halted, numbed through, on the side of
a road, and watered the horses again, and snatched a
mouthful of biscuit and bully and struggled to fill a
pipe with icy fingers. Then on again into the increasing
murk of a raw afternoon.</p>

<p>Thousands of motor lorries passed like an endless
chain. Men muffled in greatcoats emerged from farm-houses
and faintly far came the sound of guns.</p>

<p>The word went round that we were going up into
the trenches that night. Heaven knows who started
it but I found it a source of spiritual exaltation that
helped to conquer the discomfort of that ride. Every
time a trickle ran down one’s neck one thought, “It
doesn’t matter. This is the real thing. We are going
up to-night,” and visualised a Hun over the sights of
one’s rifle.</p>

<p>Presently the flames of fires lit up the murk and
shadowy forms moved round them which took no notice
of us as we rode by.</p>

<p>At last in pitch darkness we halted at a road crossing
and splashed into a farmyard that was nearly belly-deep
in mud. Voices came through the gloom, and after
some indecision and cursing we off-saddled in a stable
lit by a hurricane lamp, hand-rubbed the horses, blanketed
them and left them comfortable for the night.</p>

<p>We were given hot tea and bread and cheese and
shepherded into an enormous barn piled high with hay.
Here and there twinkled candles in biscuit tins and
everywhere were men sitting and lying on the hay, the
vague whiteness of their faces just showing. It looked
extremely comfortable.</p>

<p>But when we joined them&mdash;the trench rumour was
untrue&mdash;we found that the hay was so wet that a lighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
match thrown on it fizzled and went out. The rain came
through innumerable holes in the roof and the wind
made the candles burn all one-sided. However, it was
soft to lie on, and when my “chum” and I had got on
two pairs of dry socks each and had snuggled down
together with two blankets over our tunics and greatcoats,
and mufflers round our necks, and Balaklava
helmets over our heads we found we could sleep warm
till reveille.</p>

<p>The sock question was difficult. One took off soaking
boots and puttees at night and had to put them on again
still soaking in the morning. The result was that by
day our feet were always ice-cold and never dry. We
never took anything else off except to wash, or to groom
horses.</p>

<p>The next morning I had my first lesson in real soldiering.
The results were curious.</p>

<p>The squadron was to parade in drill order at 9 a.m.
We had groomed diligently in the chilly dawn. None
of the horses had been clipped, so it consisted in getting
the mud off rather than really grooming, and I was glad
to see that my horse had stood the train journey and
the previous day’s ride without any damage save a slight
rubbing of his tail. At about twenty minutes to nine,
shaved and washed, I went to the stables to saddle up
for the parade. Most of the others in that stable were
nearly ready by the time I got there and to my dismay
I found that they had used all my gear. There was
nothing but the horse and the blanket left,&mdash;no saddle,
no head collar and bit, no rifle, no sword, no lance.
Everything had disappeared. I dashed round and tried
to lay hands on some one else’s property. They were
too smart and eventually they all turned out leaving me.
The only saddle in the place hadn’t been cleaned for
months and I should have been ashamed to ride it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Then the sergeant appeared, a great, red-faced, bad-tempered-looking
man.</p>

<p>I decided on getting the first blow in. So I went up
and told him that all my things had been “pinched.”
Could he tell me where I could find some more?</p>

<p>His reply would have blistered the paint off a door.
His adjectives concerning me made me want to hit him.
But one cannot hit one’s superior officer in the army&mdash;more’s
the pity&mdash;on occasions like that. So we had
a verbal battle. I told him that if he didn’t find me
everything down to lance buckets I shouldn’t appear on
parade and that if he chose to put me under arrest, so
much the better, as the Major would then find out how
damned badly the sergeant ran his troop.</p>

<p>It was a good bluff. Bit by bit he hunted up a head
collar, a saddle, sword, lance, etc. Needless to say they
were all filthy and I wished all the bullets in Germany
on the dirty dog who had pinched my clean stuff. However,
I was on parade just half a minute before the
Major came round to inspect us. He stopped at me,
his eye taking in the rusty bit and stirrup irons, the
coagulations on the bridle, the general damnableness of
it all. It wasn’t nice.</p>

<p>“Did you come in last night?” The voice was
hard.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you come up from the base with your appointments
in that state?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>The sergeant was looking apoplectic behind him.</p>

<p>“These aren’t my things, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“Whose are they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where are your things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“They were in the stables at reveille, sir, but they’d
all gone when I went to saddle up. The horse is the
only thing I brought with me, sir.”</p>

<p>The whole troop was sitting at attention, listening,
and I hoped that the man who had stolen everything
heard this dialogue and was quaking in his wet boots.</p>

<p>The Major turned. “What does this mean, Sergeant?”</p>

<p>There was a vindictive look in the sergeant’s eye as
he spluttered out an unconvincing reply that “these
new fellows wanted nursemaids and weren’t ’alf nippy
enough in lookin’ arter ’emselves.”</p>

<p>The Major considered it for a moment, told me that
I must get everything clean for the next parade and
passed on.</p>

<p>At least I was not under arrest, but it wasn’t good
enough on the first morning to earn the Major’s scorn
through no fault of my own. I wanted some one’s blood.</p>

<p>Each troop leader, a subaltern, was given written
orders by the Major and left to carry them out. Our
own troop leader didn’t seem to understand his orders
and by the time the other three troops had ridden away
he was still reading his paper. The Major returned
and explained, asked him if all was clear, and getting yes
for an answer, rode off.</p>

<p>The subaltern then asked the sergeant if he had a
map!</p>

<p>What was even more curious, the sergeant said yes.
The subaltern said we had to get to a place called Flêtre
within three quarters of an hour and they proceeded to
try and find it on the sergeant’s map without any success
for perhaps five minutes.</p>

<p>During that time the troopers around me made remarks
in undertones, most ribald remarks. We had come
through Flêtre the previous day and I remembered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
road. So I turned to a lance-corporal on my right and
said, “Look here, I know the way. Shall I tell him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell him for Christ’s sake!” said the lance-corporal.
“It’s too perishin’ cold to go on sitting ’ere.”</p>

<p>So I took a deep breath and all my courage in both
hands and spoke. “I beg your pardon, sir,” said I.
“I know Flêtre.”</p>

<p>The subaltern turned round on his horse. “Who
knows the place?” he said.</p>

<p>“I do, sir,” and I told him how to get there.</p>

<p>Without further comment he gave the word to advance
in half sections and we left the parade ground, but
instead of turning to the left as I had said, he led us
straight on at a good sharp trot.</p>

<p>More than half an hour later, when we should have
been at the pin point in Flêtre, the subaltern halted us
at a crossroads in open country and again had a map
consultation with the sergeant. Again it was apparently
impossible to locate either the crossroads or the
rendezvous.</p>

<p>But in the road were two peasants coming towards
us. He waited till they came up and then asked them
the way in bad German. They looked at him blankly,
so he repeated his question in worse French. His pronunciation
of Flêtre puzzled them but at last one of them
guessed it and began a stream of explanations and
pointings.</p>

<p>“What the hell are they talking about?” said the
subaltern to the sergeant.</p>

<p>The lance-corporal nudged me. “Did <em>you</em> understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I.</p>

<p>“Tell him again,” he said. “Go on.”</p>

<p>So again I begged his pardon and explained what
the peasants had told him. He looked at me for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
moment oddly. I admit that it wasn’t usual for a
private to address his officer on parade without being
first spoken to. But this was war, the world war, and
the old order changeth. Anyhow I was told to ride in
front of the troop as guide and did and brought the troop
to the rendezvous about twenty minutes late.</p>

<p>The Major was not pleased.</p>

<p>Later in the day the subaltern came around the stables
and, seeing me, stopped and said, “Oh&mdash;er&mdash;you!”</p>

<p>I came to attention behind the horse.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” said he.</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>“Do you talk French?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where were you educated?”</p>

<p>“France and Oxford University, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” slightly surprised. “Er&mdash;all right, get on
with your work”&mdash;and whether it was he or the sergeant
I don’t know, but I had four horses to groom that
morning instead of two.</p>

<p>From that moment I decided to cut out being intelligent
and remain what the French call a “simple” soldier.</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence there was a nephew of that
subaltern in the Brigade of Gunners to which I was
posted when I received a commission. It is curious how
accurately nephews sum up uncles.</p>


<h3>17</h3>

<p>When we did not go out on drill orders like that we
began the day with what is called rough exercise. It
was. In the foggy dawn, swathed in scarfs and Balaklava
helmets, one folded one’s blanket on the horse,
bitted him, mounted, took another horse on either side,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and in a long column followed an invisible lance-corporal
across ploughed fields, over ditches, and along roads at a
good stiff trot that jarred one’s spine. It was generally
raining and always so cold that one never had the use
of either hands or feet. The result was that if one of
the unbitted led horses became frolicsome it was even
money that he would pull the rope out of one’s hands
and canter off blithely down the road,&mdash;for which one
was cursed bitterly by the sergeant on one’s return. The
rest of the day was divided between stables and fatigues
in that eternal heart-breaking mud. One laid brick
paths and brushwood paths and within twenty-four hours
they had disappeared under mud. It was shovelled
away in sacks and wheelbarrows, and it oozed up again
as if by magic. One made herring-bone drains and they
merged in the mud. There seemed to be no method of
competing with it. In the stables the horses stood in
it knee-deep. As soon as one had finished grooming, the
brute seemed to take a diabolical pleasure in lying down
in it. It became a nightmare.</p>

<p>The sergeant didn’t go out of his way to make things
easier for any of us and confided most of the dirtier,
muddier jobs to me. There seemed to be always something
unpleasant that required “intelligence,” so he
said, and in the words of the army I “clicked.” The
result was that I was happiest when I was on guard, a
twenty-four-hour duty which kept me more or less out
of the mud and entirely out of his way.</p>

<p>The first time I went on I was told by the N.C.O.
in charge that no one was to come through the hedge
that bounded the farm and the road after lights out,
and if any one attempted to do so I was to shoot on
sight. So I marched up and down my short beat in the
small hours between two and four, listening to the far-off
muttering of guns and watching the Verey lights like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
a miniature firework display, praying that some spy
would try and enter the gap in the hedge. My finger
was never very far from the trigger, and my beat was
never more than two yards from the hedge. I didn’t
realize then that we were so far from the line that the
chances of a strolling Hun were absurd. Looking back
on it I am inclined to wonder whether the N.C.O. didn’t
tell me to shoot on sight because he knew that the sergeant’s
billet was down that road and the hedge was a
short cut. The sergeant wasn’t very popular.</p>

<p>There was an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i> across the road from the farm,
and the officers had arranged for us to have the use of
the big room. It was a godsend, that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i>, with its
huge stove nearly red-hot, its bowls of coffee and the
single glass of raw cognac which they were allowed to sell
us. The evenings were the only time one was ever
warm, and although there was nothing to read except
some old and torn magazines we sat there in the fetid
atmosphere just to keep warm.</p>

<p>The patron talked vile French but was a kindly soul,
and his small boy, Gaston, aged about seven, became
a great friend of mine. He used to bring me my coffee,
his tiny, dirty hands only just big enough to hold the
bowl, and then stand and talk while I drank it, calling
me “thou.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">T’es pas anglais, dis?</i>”</p>

<p>And I laughed and said I was French.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alors comment qu’ t’es avec eux, dis?</i>”</p>

<p>And when one evening he came across and looked
over my shoulder as I was writing a letter, he said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qué
que t’écris, dis?</i>”</p>

<p>I told him I was writing in English.</p>

<p>He stared at me and then called out shrilly, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Papa.
V’là l’Français qu’écrit en anglais!</i>”</p>

<p>He had seen the Boche, had little Gaston, and told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
me how one day the Uhlans had cleaned the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i>
out of everything,&mdash;wine, cognac, bread, blankets,
sheets&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les sales Boches!</i></p>

<p>As the days dragged muddily through it was borne
in on me that this wasn’t fighting for King and Country.
It was just Tidworth over again with none of its advantages
and with all its discomforts increased a thousand-fold.
Furthermore the post-office seemed to have lost
me utterly, and weeks went by before I had any letters
at all. It was heart-breaking to see the mail distributed
daily and go away empty-handed. It was as though no
one cared, as though one were completely forgotten, as
though in stepping into this new life one had renounced
one’s identity. Indeed, every day it became more
evident that it was not I who was in that mud patch.
It was some one else on whom the real me looked down in
infinite amazement. I heard myself laugh in the farm
at night and join in choruses; saw myself dirty and
unbathed, with a scarf around my stomach and another
round my feet, and a woollen helmet over my head;
standing in the mud stripped to the waist shaving without
a looking-glass; drinking coffee and cognac in that
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i>.&mdash;Was it I who sometimes prayed for sleep
that I might shut it all out and slip into the land of
dreams, where there is no war and no mud? Was it I
who when the first letters arrived from home went out
into the rainy night with a candle-end to be alone with
those I loved? And was it only the rain which made
it so difficult to read them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>


<h3>18</h3>

<p>The culminating point was reached when I became
ill.</p>

<p>Feeling sick, I couldn’t eat any breakfast and dragged
myself on parade like a mangy cat. I stuck it till about
three in the afternoon, when the horse which I was
grooming receded from me and the whole world rocked.
I remember hanging on to the horse till things got a bit
steadier, and then asked the sergeant if I might go off
parade. I suppose I must have looked pretty ill because
he said yes at once.</p>

<p>For three days I lay wrapped up on the straw in the
barn, eating nothing; and only crawling out to see the
doctor each morning at nine o’clock. Of other symptoms
I will say nothing. The whole affair was appalling, but
I recovered sufficient interest in life on the fourth morning
to parade sick, although I felt vastly more fit.
Indeed, the argument formed itself, “since I am a soldier
I’ll play the ‘old soldier’ and see how long I can be
excused duty.” And I did it so well that for three more
days I was to all intents and purposes a free man. On
one of the days I fell in with a corporal of another
squadron, and he and I got a couple of horses and rode
into Bailleul, which was only about three miles south of
us, and we bought chocolates, and candles and books,
and exchanged salutes with the Prince of Wales, who
was walking in the town. Then we came back with our
supplies after an excellent lunch at the hotel in the
square, the “Faucon,” and had tea with the officers’
servants in a cosy little billet with a fire and beds. The
remarks they made about their officers were most in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>structive,
and they referred to them either as “my
bloke” or “’is lordship.”</p>

<p>And there it was I met again a man I had spoken to
once at Tidworth, who knew French and was now
squadron interpreter. He was a charming man of
considerable means, with a large business, who had
joined up immediately on the outbreak of war. But
being squadron interpreter he messed with the officers,
had a billet in a cottage, slept on a bed, had a private
hip bath and hot water, and was in heaven, comparatively.
He suggested to me that as my squadron lacked an
interpreter (he was doing the extra work) and I knew
French it was up to me.</p>

<p>“But how the devil’s it to be done?” said I, alight
with the idea.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go and see the Colonel?” he
suggested.</p>

<p>I gasped. The Colonel was nearly God.</p>

<p>He laughed. “This is ‘Kitchener’s Army,’” he
said, “not the regular Army. Things are a bit different.”
They were indeed!</p>

<p>So I slept on the idea and every moment it seemed
to me better and better, until the following evening
after tea, instead of going to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i>, I went down
to squadron headquarters. For about five minutes I
walked up and down in the mud, plucking up courage.
I would rather have faced a Hun any day.</p>

<p>At last I went into the farmyard and knocked at the
door. There were lights in the crack of the window
shutters.</p>

<p>A servant answered the door.</p>

<p>“Is the Colonel in?” said I boldly.</p>

<p>He peered at me. “What the perishin’ ’ell do <em>you</em>
want to know for?”</p>

<p>“I want to see him,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“And what the ’ell do <em>you</em> want to see him for?”</p>

<p>I was annoyed. It seemed quite likely that this
confounded servant would do the St. Peter act and
refuse me entrance into the gates.</p>

<p>“Look here,” I said, “it doesn’t matter to you what
for or why. You’re here to answer questions. Is the
Colonel <em>in</em>?”</p>

<p>The man snorted. “Oh! I’m ’ere to answer questions,
am I? Well, if you want to know, the Colonel ain’t
in.&mdash;Anything else?”</p>

<p>I was stumped. It seemed as if my hopes were
shattered. But luck was mine&mdash;as ever. A voice
came from the inner room. “Thomson! Who is that
man?”</p>

<p>The servant made a face at me and went to the room
door.</p>

<p>“A trooper, sir, from one of the squadrons, askin’ to
see the Colonel.”</p>

<p>“Bring him in,” said the voice.</p>

<p>My heart leapt.</p>

<p>The servant returned to me and showed me into the
room.</p>

<p>I saw three officers, one in shirt sleeves, all sitting
around a fire. Empty tea things were still on a table.
There were a sofa, and armchairs and bright pictures, a
pile of books and magazines on a table, and a smell of
Egyptian cigarettes. They all looked at me as I saluted.</p>

<p>“Thomson tells me you want to see the Colonel,”
said the one whose voice I had heard, the one in shirt
sleeves. “Anything I can do?”</p>

<p>It was good to hear one’s own language again, and I
decided to make a clean breast of it.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully kind of you, sir,” said I. “Perhaps you
can. I came to ask for the interpretership of my
squadron. We haven’t got one and I can talk French.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
If you could put in a word for me I should be lastingly
grateful.”</p>

<p>His next words made him my brother for life. “Sit
down, won’t you,” he said, “and have a cigarette.”</p>

<p>Can you realize what it meant after those weeks of
misery, with no letters and the eternal adjective of the
ranks which gets on one’s nerves till one could scream,
to be asked to sit down and have a cigarette in that
officers’ mess?</p>

<p>Speechless, I took one, although I dislike cigarettes
and always stick to a pipe. But that one was a link
with all that I’d left behind, and was the best I’ve ever
smoked in my life. He proceeded to ask me my name
and where I was educated, and said he would see what
he could do for me, and after about ten minutes I went
out again into the mud a better soldier than I went in.
That touch of fellow feeling helped enormously. And
he was as good as his word. For the following morning
the Major sent for me.</p>


<h3>19</h3>

<p>The rain had stopped and there had been a hard
frost in the night which turned the roads to ice. The
horses were being walked round and round in a circle,
and the Major was standing watching them when I came
up and saluted.</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it?” he said.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;you’re Gibbs, are you?&mdash;Yes, let’s go in out
of this wind.” He led the way into the mess and stood
with his back to the fire.</p>

<p>Every detail of that room lives with me yet. One
went up two steps into the room. The fireplace faced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
the door with a window to the right of the fireplace.
There was a table between us with newspapers on it,
and tobacco and pipes. And two armchairs faced the
fire.</p>

<p>He asked me what I wanted the interpretership for.
I told him I was sick of the ranks, that I had chucked
a fascinating job to be of use to my King and country,
and that any fool trooper could shovel mud as I did day
after day.</p>

<p>He nodded. “But interpreting is no damned good,
you know,” he said. “It only consists in looking after
the forage and going shopping with those officers who
can’t talk French.&mdash;That isn’t what you want, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, what other job would you like?”</p>

<p>That floored me completely. I didn’t know what
jobs there were in the squadron and told him so.</p>

<p>“Well, come and have dinner to-night and we’ll
talk about it,” said he.</p>

<p>Have dinner! My clothes reeked of stables, and I
had slept in them ever since I arrived.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” said the Major. “You
come along to-night at half-past seven. You’ve been
sick all this week. How are you? Pretty fit again?”</p>

<p>He’s Brigadier-General now and has forgotten all
about it years ago. I don’t think I ever shall.</p>

<p>There were the Major, the Captain and one subaltern
at dinner that night&mdash;an extraordinary dinner&mdash;the
servant who a moment previously had called me “chum”
in the kitchen gradually getting used to waiting on me
at the meal, and I, in the same dress as the servant,
gradually feeling less like a fish out of water as the
officers treated me as one of themselves. It was the
first time I’d eaten at a table covered with a white tablecloth
for over two months, the first time I had used a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
plate or drunk out of a glass, the first time I had been
with my own kind.&mdash;It was very good.</p>

<p>The outcome of the dinner was that I was to become
squadron scout, have two horses, keep them at the
cottage of the interpreter, where I was to live, and ride
over the country gathering information, which I was
to bring as a written report every night at six o’clock.
While the squadron was behind the lines it was, of course,
only a matter of training myself before other men were
given me to train. But when we went into action,&mdash;vistas
opened out before me of dodging Uhlan patrols
and galloping back with information through a rain of
bullets. It was a job worth while and I was speechless
with gratitude.</p>

<p>It was not later than seven o’clock the following
morning, Christmas Eve, 1914, that I began operations.
I breakfasted at the cottage to which I had removed my
belongings overnight, and went along towards the stables
to get a horse.</p>

<p>The man with whom I had been mucking in met me
outside the farm. He was in the know and grinned,
cheerily.</p>

<p>“The sergeant’s lookin’ for you,” he said. “He’s
over in the stables.”</p>

<p>I went across. He was prowling about near the
forage.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Sergeant,” said I.</p>

<p>He looked at me and stopped prowling. “Where
the&mdash;&mdash;” and he asked me in trooperese where I had
been and why I wasn’t at early morning stables. I told
him I was on a special job for the Major.</p>

<p>He gasped and requested an explanation.</p>

<p>“I’m knocked off all rolls, and parades and fatigues,”
I said. “You’ve got to find me a second horse. They
are both going to be kept down the road, and I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
come and see you from time to time when I require
forage.”</p>

<p>He was speechless for the first and only time. It
passed his comprehension.</p>

<p>At that moment the sergeant-major came in and proceeded
to tell him almost word for word what I had told
him. It was a great morning, a poetic revenge, and
eventually I rode away leading the other horse, the
sergeant’s pop eyes following me as I gave him final
instructions as to where to send the forage.</p>

<p>Later, as I started out on my first expedition as
squadron scout, he waved an arm at me and came running.
His whole manner had changed, and he said in a
voice of honey, “If you <em>should</em> ’appen to pass through
Ballool would you mind gettin’ me a new pipe?&mdash;’Ere’s
five francs.”</p>

<p>I got him a pipe, and in Bailleul sought out every
likely looking English signaller or French officer, and
dropped questions, and eventually at 6 p.m., having been
the round of Dramoutre, Westoutre, and Locre, took in
a rather meagre first report to the Major. How I
regretted that I had never been a newspaper reporter!
However, it was a beginning.</p>

<p>The following morning was Christmas Day, cold and
foggy, and before starting out I went about a mile down
the road to another farm and heard Mass in a barn. An
odd little service for Christmas morning. The altar
was made of a couple of biscuit boxes in an open barn.
The priest wore his vestments, and his boots and spurs
showed underneath. About half a dozen troopers with
rifles were all the congregation, and we kneeled on the
damp ground.</p>

<p>The first Christmas at Bethlehem came to mind most
forcibly. The setting was the same. An icy wind
blew the wisps of straw and the lowing of a cow could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
be heard in the byre. Where the Magi brought frankincense
and myrrh we brought our hopes and ambitions
and laid them at the Child’s feet, asking Him to take
care of them for us while we went out to meet the great
adventure. What a contrast to the previous Christmas,
in the gold and sunshine of Miami, Florida, splashed with
the scarlet flowers of the bougainvillea, and at night
the soft, feathery palms leaning at a curious angle in the
hard moonlight as though a tornado had once swept
over the land.</p>

<p>The farm people sold me a bowl of coffee and a slice
of bread, and I mounted and rode away into the fog
with an apple and a piece of chocolate in my pocket, the
horse slipping and sliding on the icy road. Not a sound
broke the dead silence except the blowing of my horse
and his hoofs on the road. Every gun was silent during
the whole day, as though the Child had really brought
peace and good will.</p>

<p>I got to within a couple of miles of Ypres by the map,
and saw nothing save a few peasants who emerged out
of the blanket of fog on their way to Mass. A magpie
or two flashed across my way, and there was only an
occasional infantryman muffled to the eyes when I passed
through the scattered villages.</p>

<p>About midday I nibbled some chocolate, and watered
my horse and gave him a feed, feeling more and more
miserable because there was no means of getting any
information. My imagination drew pictures of the
Major, on my return with a blank confession of failure,
telling me that I was no good and had better return to
duty. As the short afternoon drew in, my spirits sank
lower and lower. They were below zero when at last I
knocked reluctantly at the door of the mess and stood
to attention inside. To make things worse all the officers
were there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Gibbs?” said the Major.</p>

<p>“It isn’t well, sir,” said I. “I’m afraid I’m no damn
good. I haven’t got a thing to report,” and I told him
of my ride.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. The Major flicked off
the ash of his cigarette. “My dear fellow,” he said
quietly, “you can’t expect to get the hang of the job
in five minutes. Don’t be impatient with it. Give it a
chance.”</p>

<p>It was like a reprieve to a man awaiting the hangman.</p>


<h3>20</h3>

<p>The squadron, having been on duty that day, had
not celebrated Christmas, but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i> was a mass
of holly and mistletoe in preparation for to-morrow, and
talk ran high on the question of the dinner and concert
that were to take place. There were no letters for me,
but in spite of it I felt most unaccountably and absurdly
happy as I left the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i> and went back to my billet
and got to bed.</p>

<p>The interpreter came in presently. He had been
dining well and Christmas exuded from him as he smoked
a cigar on the side of his bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way,” he said, “your commission has
come through. They were talking about it in mess
to-night. Congratulations.”</p>

<p>Commission! My heart jumped back to the Marlborough
Hotel.</p>

<p>“I expect you’ll be going home to-morrow,” he went
on; “lucky devil.”</p>

<p>Home! Could it be? Was it possible that I was
going to escape from all this mud and filth? Home.
What a Christmas present! No more waiting for letters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
that never came. No more of the utter loneliness and
indifference that seemed to fill one’s days and nights.</p>

<p>The dingy farm room and the rough army blanket
faded and in their place came a woman’s face in a setting
of tall red pines and gleaming patches of moss and high
bracken and a green lawn running up to a little house of
gables, with chintz-curtained windows, warm tiles and
red chimneys, and a shining river twisting in stately
loops. And instead of the guns which were thundering
the more fiercely after their lull, there came the mewing
of sandpipers, and the gurgle of children’s laughter, and
the voice of that one woman who had given me the
vision.&mdash;</p>


<h3>21</h3>

<p>The journey home was a foretaste of the return to
civilisation, of stepping not only out of one’s trooper’s
khaki but of resuming one’s identity, of counting in the
scheme of things. In the ranks one was a number, like
a convict,&mdash;a cipher indeed, and as such it was a struggle
to keep one’s soul alive. One had given one’s body.
They wanted one’s soul as well. By “they” I mean
the system, that extraordinary self-contained world
which is the Army, where the private is marched to
church whether he have a religion or not, where he is
forced to think as the sergeant thinks and so on, right up
to the General commanding. How few officers realise
that it is in their power to make the lives of their juniors
and men a hell or a heaven.</p>

<p>It was a merciful thing for me that I was able to escape
so soon, to climb out of that mental and physical morass
and get back to myself.</p>

<p>From the squadron I went by motor lorry to Hazebrouck
and thence in a first-class carriage to Boulogne,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and although the carriage was crowded I thought of the
horse truck in which I’d come up from Rouen, and
chuckled. At Boulogne I was able to help the Major,
who was going on leave. He had left a shirt case in the
French luggage office weeks before and by tackling the
porter in his own tongue, I succeeded in digging it out
in five minutes. It was the only thing I’ve ever been
able to do to express the least gratitude,&mdash;and how
ridiculously inadequate.</p>

<p>We spent the night in a hotel and caught the early
boat, horribly early. But it was worth it. We reached
London about two in the afternoon, a rainy, foggy, depressing
afternoon, but if it had snowed ink I shouldn’t
have minded. I was above mere weather, sailing in the
blue ether of radiant happiness. In this case the realisation
came up to and even exceeded the expectation.
Miserable-looking policemen in black waterproof capes
were things of beauty. The noise of the traffic was
sweetest music. The sight of dreary streets with soaked
pedestrians made one’s eyes brim with joy. The swish
of the taxi round abrupt corners made me burst with song.
I was glad of the rain and the sort of half-fog. It was
so typically London and when the taxi driver stopped at
my brother’s house and said to me as I got out, “Just
back from the front, chum?” I laughed madly and
scandalously overtipped him. No one else would ever
call me chum. That was done with. I was no longer
7205 Trooper A. H. Gibbs, 9th Lancers. I was Second
Lieutenant A. Hamilton Gibbs, R.F.A. and could feel the
stars sprouting.</p>

<p>My brother wasn’t at home. He was looking like an
admiral still and working like the devil. But his wife
was and she most wisely lent me distant finger tips and
hurried me to a bath, what time she telephoned to my
brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>That bath! I hadn’t had all my clothes off more than
once in six weeks and had slept in them every night.
Ever tried it? Well, if you really want to know just how
I felt about that first bath, you try it.</p>

<p>I stayed in it so long that my sister-in-law became
anxious and tapped at the door to know if I were all
right. All right! Before I was properly dressed&mdash;but
running about the house most shamelessly for all that&mdash;my
brother arrived.</p>

<p>It was good to see him again,&mdash;very good. We
“foregathered,”&mdash;what?</p>

<p>And the next morning scandalously early, the breakfast
things still on the table, found me face to face once
more with the woman who had brought me back to life.
All that nightmare was immediately washed away for
ever. It was past. The future was too vague for
imaginings but the present was the most golden thing
I had ever known.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">The Division of Field Artillery to which I was
posted by the War Office was training at Bulford
up to its neck in mud, but the brigade had moved to
Fleet two days before I joined. By that time&mdash;it was
a good fifteen days since I had come home&mdash;I had grown
accustomed to the feel and splendour of a Sam Browne
belt and field boots and the recurring joy of being saluted
not merely by Tommies but by exalted beings like
sergeants and sergeant-majors; and I felt mentally as
well as physically clean.</p>

<p>At the same time I arrived at the Fleet Golf Club,
where most of the officers were billeted, feeling vastly
diffident. I’d never seen a gun, never given a command
in my life and hadn’t the first or foggiest idea of the sort
of things gunners did, and my only experience of an
officers’ mess was my dinner with the Major in France.
Vaguely I knew that there was a certain etiquette demanded.
It was rather like a boy going to a new school.</p>

<p>It was tea time and dark when the cab dropped me
at the door and the place was practically empty. However,
an officer emerged, asked me if I’d come to join, and
led me in to tea. Presently, however, a crowd swarmed
in, flung wet mackintoshes and caps about the hall and
began devouring bread and jam in a way that more
and more resembled school. They looked me over with
the unintentional insolence of all Englishmen and one
or two spoke. They were a likely-looking lot, mostly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
amazingly young and full of a vitality that was like an
electric current. One, a fair willowy lad with one or two
golden fluffs that presumably did duty as a moustache,
took me in hand. He was somewhat fancifully called
Pot-face but he had undoubtedly bought the earth and
all things in it. Having asked and received my name
he informed me that I was posted to his battery and
introduced me to the other subaltern, also of his battery.
This was a pale, blue-eyed, head-on-one-side, sensitive
youth who was always just a moment too late with his
repartee. Pot-face, who possessed a nimble, sarcastic
tongue, took an infinite delight in baiting him to the
verge of tears. His nickname, to which incidentally
he refused to answer, was the Fluttering Palm.</p>

<p>The others did not assume individualities till later.
It was an amusing tea and afterwards we adjourned to
the big club room with two fireplaces and straw armchairs
and golfing pictures. The senior officers were
there and before I could breathe Pot-face had introduced
me to the Colonel, the Adjutant, and the Captain commanding
our battery, a long, thin, dark man with India
stamped all over him and a sudden infectious laugh that
crinkled all his face. He turned out to be the owner of a
vitriolic tongue.</p>

<p>A lecture followed, one of a series which took place two
or three evenings a week attended by all the officers in
the brigade, a good two thirds of whom were billeted in
the village and round about. Of technical benefit I don’t
think I derived any, because I knew no gunnery, but it
helped me to get to know everybody. A further help
in that respect was afforded by my Captain who on that
first evening proposed getting up a concert. Having had
two years on the stage in America I volunteered to
help and was at once made O. C. Concert. This gave
me a sort of standing, took away the awful newness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and entirely filled my spare time for two weeks. The
concert was a big success and from that night I felt at
home.</p>

<p>To me, after my experience in the ranks, everything
was new and delightful. We were all learning, subalterns
as well as men. Only the Colonel and the Battery Commanders
were regulars and every single officer and man was
keen. The work therefore went with a will that surprised
me. The men were a different class altogether to
those with whom I had been associated. There were
miners, skilled men, clerks, people of some education and
distinct intelligence. Then too the officers came into
much closer contact with them than in the Cavalry. Our
training had been done solely under the sergeant-major.
Here in the Gunners the officers not only took every
parade and lecture and stable hour and knew every man
and horse by name, but played in all the inter-battery
football matches. It was a different world, much more
intimate and much better organised. We worked hard
and played hard. Riding was of course most popular
because each of us had a horse. But several had motor-bicycles
and went for joy-rides half over the south of
England between tattoo and reveille. Then the Golf
Club made us honorary members, and the Colonel and
I had many a match, and he almost invariably beat me
by one hole.</p>

<p>My ignorance of gunnery was monumental and it was
a long time before I grasped even the first principles.
The driving drill part of it didn’t worry me. The Cavalry
had taught me to feel at home in the saddle and the
drawing of intricate patterns on the open country with
a battery of four guns was a delightful game soon learnt.
But once they were in action I was lost. It annoyed me
to listen helplessly while children of nineteen with squeaky
voices fired imaginary salvos on imaginary targets and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
got those gunners jumping. So I besought the Colonel
to send me on a course to Shoebury and he did.</p>

<p>Work? I’d never known what it meant till I went
to Shoebury and put on a canvas duck suit. We paraded
at ungodly hours in the morning, wet or fine, took guns
to bits and with the instructor’s help put them together
again; did gun drill by the hour and learnt it by heart
from the handbook and shouted it at each other from a
distance; spent hours in the country doing map-reading
and re-section; sat through hours of gunnery lectures
where the mysteries of a magic triangle called T.O.B.
became more and more unfathomable; knocked out
countless churches on a miniature range with a precision
that was quite Boche-like; waded through a ghastly
tabloid book called F.A.T. and flung the thing in despair
at the wall half a dozen times a day; played billiards at
night when one had been clever enough to arrive first at the
table by means of infinite manœuvring; ate like a Trojan,
got dog-tired <ins class="corr" id="tn-78" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'by 9 P.M.'">
by 9 p.m.</ins>, slept like a child; dashed up to
London every week-end and went to the theatre, and
became in fact the complete Shoeburyite.</p>

<p>Finally I returned to the brigade extraordinarily fit,
very keen and with perhaps the first glimmerings of what
a gun was. A scourge of a mysterious skin disease ran
through the horses at that time. It looked like ringworm
and wasn’t,&mdash;according to the Vet. But we subalterns
vied with each other in curing our sections and worked
day and night on those unfortunate animals with tobacco
juice, sulphur and every unpleasant means available until
they looked the most wretched brutes in the world.</p>

<p>Little by little the training built itself up. From
standing gun drill we crept to battery gun drill and
then took the battery out for the day and lost it round
Aldershot in that glorious pine country, coming into
action over and over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>The Colonel watched it all from a distance with a
knowledgeable eye and at last took a hand. Brigade
shows then took place, batteries working in conjunction
with each other and covering zones.</p>

<p>Those were good days in the early spring with all the
birds in full chorus, clouds scudding across a blue sky,
and the young green feathering all the trees, days of hard
physical work with one’s blood running free and the companionship
of one’s own kind; inspired by a friendly
rivalry in doing a thing just a little bit better than the
other fellow&mdash;or trying to: with an occasional week-end
flung in like a sparkling jewel.</p>

<p>And France? Did we think about it? Yes, when
the lights were turned out at night and only the point of
the final cigarette like a glowworm marked the passage
of hand to mouth. Then the talk ran on brothers “out
there” and the chances of our going soon. None of
them had been except me, but I could only give them
pictures of star-shell at night and the heart-breaking
mud, and they wanted gunner talk.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary what a bond grew up between
us all in those days, shared, I think, by the senior officers.
We declared ourselves the first brigade in the Division, and
each battery was of course hotly the finest in the
brigade; our Colonel was miles above any other
Colonel in the Army and our Battery Commanders
the best fellows that ever stepped. By God, we’d
show Fritz!&mdash;&mdash;</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>We had left Fleet and the golf club and moved into
hutments at Deepcut about the time I returned from the
gunnery course. Now the talk centred round the firing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
practice when every man and officer would be put to the
test and one fine morning the order came to proceed to
Trawsfynydd, Wales.</p>

<p>We “proceeded” by train, taking only guns, firing
battery wagons and teams and after long, long hours
found ourselves tucked away in a camp in the mountains
with great blankets of mist rolling down and blotting
everything out, the ground a squelching bog of tussocks
with outcrops of rock sprouting up everywhere. A
strange, hard, cold country, with unhappy houses, grey
tiled and lonely, and peasants whose faces seemed
marked by the desolation of it all.</p>

<p>The range was a rolling stretch of country falling away
from a plateau high above us, reached by a corkscrew
path that tore the horses to pieces, and cut up by stone
walls and nullahs which after an hour’s rain foamed with
brown water. Through glasses we made out the targets&mdash;four
black dots representing a battery, a row of tiny
figures for infantry, and a series of lines indicating
trenches. For three days the weather prevented us from
shooting but at last came a morning when the fog blanket
rolled back and the guns were run up, and little puffs
of cotton wool appeared over the targets, the hills ringing
with countless echoes as though they would never tire
of the firing.</p>

<p>Each subaltern was called up in turn and given a
target by the Colonel who, lying silently on his stomach,
watched results through his glasses and doubtless in his
mind summed each of us up from the methods of our orders
to the battery, the nimbleness and otherwise with which
we gauged and corrected them. A trying ordeal which
was, however, all too short. Sixteen rounds apiece were
all that we were allowed. We would have liked six
hundred, so fascinating and bewildering was the new
game. It seemed as if the guns took a malignant pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
in disobeying our orders, each gun having its own particular
devil to compete with.</p>

<p>In the light of to-day the explanation is simple. There
was no such thing as calibration then, that exorciser of
the evil spirit in all guns.</p>

<p>And so, having seen at last a practical demonstration
of what I had long considered a fact&mdash;that the Gunners’
Bible F.A.T. (the handbook of Field Artillery Training)
was a complete waste of time, we all went back to Deepcut
even more than ever convinced that we were the finest
brigade in England. And all on the strength of sixteen
rounds apiece!</p>

<p>Almost at once I was removed from the scientific
activities necessitated by being a battery subaltern. An
apparently new establishment was made, a being called
an Orderly Officer, whose job was to keep the Colonel in
order and remind the Adjutant of all the things he forgot.
In addition to those two matters of supreme moment
there were one or two minor duties like training the brigade
signallers to lay out cables and buzz messages, listen to
the domestic troubles of the regimental sergeant-major,
whose importance is second only to that of the Colonel,
look after some thirty men and horses and a cable wagon
and endeavour to keep in the good books of the Battery
Commanders.</p>

<p>I got the job&mdash;and kept it for over a year.</p>

<p>Colonel, didn’t I keep you in order?</p>

<p>Adj, did I <em>ever</em> do any work for you?</p>

<p>Battery Commanders, didn’t I come and cadge drinks
daily&mdash;and incidentally wasn’t that cable which I laid
from Valandovo to Kajali the last in use before the
Bulgar pushed us off the earth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>So I forgot the little I ever knew about gunnery and
laid spiders’ webs from my cable wagon all over Deepcut,
and galloped for the Colonel on Divisional training
stunts with a bottle of beer and sandwiches in each wallet
against the hour when the General, feeling hungry,
should declare an armistice with the opposing force and
Colonels and their Orderly Officers might replenish their
inner men. Brave days of great lightheartedness, untouched
by the shadow of what was to come after.</p>

<p>May had put leaves on all the trees and called forth
flowers in every garden. Then came June to perfect her
handiwork and with it the call to lay aside our golf clubs
and motor-cycles, to say good-bye to England in all her
beauty and go out once more to do our bit.</p>

<p>There was much bustle and packing of kits and writing
of letters and heartburnings over last week-end leaves
refused and through it all a thirst for knowledge of where
we were going. Everything was secret, letters severely
censored. Rumour and counter-rumour chased each
other through the camp until, an hour before starting, the
Captain in whose battery I had begun appeared with a
motor car full of topees.</p>

<p>Then all faces like true believers were turned towards
the East and on every tongue was the word Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Avonmouth was the port of embarkation and there
we filled a mass of waiting boats, big and little.</p>

<p>The Colonel, the Adjutant and I were on one of the
biggest. My horses had been handed over to a battery
for the voyage and I had only the signallers to look
after. Everything was complete by ten o’clock in the
morning. The convoy would not sail till midnight, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
some of us got leave to explore and took train to Bristol,
lunching royally for the last time in a restaurant, buying
innumerable novels to read on board, sending final
telegrams home.</p>

<p>How very different it was to the first going out! No
red lead. No mud. The reality had departed. It
seemed like going on a picnic, a merry outing with cheery
souls, a hot sun trickling down one’s back; and not
one of us but heard the East a-calling.</p>

<p>A curious voyage that was when we had sorted ourselves
out. The mornings were taken up with a few
duties,&mdash;physical jerks, chin inspection and Grand
Rounds when we stood stiffly to attention, rocking with
the sway of the boat while the two commanders of the
sister services inspected the ship; life-boat drill, a little
signalling; and then long hours in scorching sunshine,
to lie in a deck chair gazing out from the saloon deck
upon the infinite blue, trying to find the answer to the
why of it all, arguing the alpha and omega with one’s
pals, reading the novels we had bought in Bristol, writing
home, sleeping. Torpedoes and mines? We never
thought about them.</p>

<p>Boxing competitions and sports were organized for
the men and they hammered each other’s faces to pulp
with the utmost good fellowship.</p>

<p>Then we passed The Rock and with our first glimpse
of the African coast&mdash;a low brown smudge&mdash;we began
to stir restlessly and think of terra firma. It broke the
spell of dreams which had filled the long days. Maps
were produced and conferences held, and we studied
eagerly the contours of Gallipoli, discussed the detail
of landings and battery positions, wagon lines and signalling
arrangements, even going so far as to work off our
bearing of the line of fire. Fragments of war news were
received by wireless and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i> was posted daily,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
but it all seemed extraordinarily unreal, as though it
were taking place in another world.</p>

<p>One night we saw a fairyland of piled-up lights which
grew swiftly as we drew nearer and took shape in filigreed
terraces and arcades when our anchor at last dropped
with a mighty roar in Valetta harbour. Tiny boats
like gondolas were moored at the water’s edge in tight
rows, making in the moonlight a curious scalloped
fringe. People in odd garments passed in noiseless
swarms up and down the streets, cabs went by, shop
doors opened and shut, and behind all those lights
loomed the impenetrable blackness of the land towering
up like a mountain. From the distance at which we
were anchored no sound could be heard save that of
shipping, and those ant-sized people going about their
affairs, regardless of the thousands of eyes watching
them, gave one the effect of looking at a stage from the
gallery through the wrong end of an opera glass.</p>

<p>Coaling began within an hour, and all that night
bronze figures naked to the waist and with bare feet
slithered up and down the swaying planks, tireless,
unceasing, glistening in the arc light which spluttered
from the mast of the coaling vessel; the grit of coal
dust made one’s shoes crunch as one walked the decks in
pyjamas, filled one’s hair and neck, and on that stifling
night became as one of the plagues of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>A strange discordant chattering waked one next
morning as though a tribe of monkeys had besieged the
ship. Then one leaped to the port-hole to get a glimpse
of Malta, to us the first hint of the mysterious East.
There it was, glistening white against the turquoise blue,
built up in fascinating tiers with splashes of dark green
trees clinging here and there as though afraid of losing
their hold and toppling into the sea. All round the ship
the sea was dotted with boats and dark people yelling and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
shouting, all reds and blues and bright yellows; piles
of golden fruit and coloured shawls; big boats with high
snub noses, the oarsmen standing, showing rows of
gleaming teeth; baby boats the size of walnut shells
with naked brown babies uttering shrill cries and diving
like frogs for silver coins.</p>

<p>Was it possible that just a little farther on we should
meet one end of the line of death that made a red gash
right across Europe?</p>

<p>We laughed a little self-consciously under the unusual
feel of our topees and went ashore to try and get
some drill khaki. Finding none we drank cool drinks
and bought cigars and smiled at the milk sellers with
their flocks of goats and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café au lait</i> coloured girls,
some of whom moved with extraordinary grace and
looked very pretty under their black mantillas. The
banks distrusted us and would give us no money, and the
Base cashier refused to undo his purse strings. We
cursed him and tried unsuccessfully to borrow from
each other, having only a few pounds in our pockets.
Down a back street we found a Japanese tattooist and
in spite of the others’ ridicule I added a highly coloured
but pensive parrot to my collection. But the heat was
overwhelming and our puttees and tunics became
streaked with sweat. We were glad to get back to the
boat and lie in a cold bath and climb languidly into the
comparative coolness of slacks. The men had not been
allowed ashore but hundreds of them dived overboard
and swam round the boat, and the native fruit sellers
did a thriving trade.</p>

<p>After dinner we went ashore again. It was not much
cooler. We wandered into various places of amusement.
They were all the same, large dirty halls with a small
stage and a piano and hundreds of marble-topped tables
where one sat and drank. Atrociously fat women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
appeared on the stage and sang four songs apiece in bad
French. It didn’t matter whether the first song was
greeted with stony silence or the damning praise of one
sarcastic laugh. Back came each one until she’d finished
her repertoire. Getting bored with that I collected a
fellow sufferer and together we went out and made our
way to the top of the ramparts. The sky looked as if a
giant had spilt all the diamonds in the world. They
glittered and changed colour. The sea was also powdered
as if little bits of diamond dust had dropped from the
sky. The air smelled sweet and a little strange, and in
that velvety darkness which one could almost touch
one’s imagination went rioting.</p>

<p>As if that were not enough a guitar somewhere down
below was suddenly touched with magic fingers and a
little love song floated up in a soft lilting tenor.&mdash;We
were very silent on the old wall.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>The next morning on waking up, that song still echoing
in our ears, we were hull down. Only a vague disturbance
in the blue showed where Malta had been, and but
for the tattoo which irritated slightly, it might have been
one of the Thousand and One Nights. We arrived at
last at Alexandria instead of Gallipoli. The shore
authorities lived up to the best standards of the
Staff.</p>

<p>They said, “Who the devil are you?”</p>

<p>And we replied, “The &mdash;&mdash; Division.”</p>

<p>And they said, “We’ve never heard of you, don’t
know where you come from, have no instructions about
you, and you’d better buzz off again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>But we beamed at them and said, “To hell with you.
We’re going to land,”&mdash;and landed.</p>

<p>There were no arrangements for horses or men; and
M.L.O.’s in all the glory of staff hats and armlets chattered
like impotent monkeys. We were busy, however,
improvising picketing-ropes from ships’ cables borrowed
from the amused ship’s commander and we smiled
politely and said, “Yes, it <em>is</em> hot,” and went on with
the work. Never heard of the &mdash;&mdash; Division? Well, well!</p>

<p>Hot? We had never known what heat was before.
We thought we did lying about on deck, but when it
came to working for hours on end,&mdash;tunics disappeared
and collars and ties followed them. The horses looked
as if they had been out in the rain and left a watery trail
as we formed up and marched out of the harbour and
through the town. We bivouacked for the night in a
rest camp called Karaissi where there wasn’t enough
room and tempers ran high until a couple of horses broke
loose in the dark and charged the tent in which there
were two Colonels. The tent ropes went with a ping
and camp beds and clothing and Colonels were mixed
up in the sand. No one was hurt, so we emptied the
Colonels’ pyjamas, called their servants and went away
and laughed.</p>

<p>Then we hooked in and marched again, and in the
middle of the afternoon found Mamoura&mdash;a village of
odd smells, naked children, filthy women and pariah
dogs&mdash;and pitched camp on the choking sand half a mile
from the seashore.</p>

<p>By this time the horses were nearly dead and the only
water was a mile and a half away and full of sand. But
they drank it, poor brutes, by the gallon,&mdash;and two days
after we had our first case of sand colic.</p>

<p>The Staff were in marquees on the seashore. Presumably
being bored, having nothing earthly to do,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
they began to exhibit a taste for design and each day the
camp was moved, twenty yards this way, fifteen that,
twelve and a half the other, until, thank God, the sun
became too much for them and they retired to suck cool
drinks through straws and think up a new game.</p>

<p>By this time the Colonel had refused to play and removed
himself, lock, stock and barrel, to the hotel in
the village. The Adjutant was praying aloud for the mud
of Flanders. The Orderly Officer made himself scarce
and the Battery Commanders were telling Indian snake
stories at breakfast. The sergeants and the men, half
naked and with tongues hanging out, were searching for
beer.</p>

<p>The days passed relentlessly, scorching hot, the only
work, watering the horses four times a day, leaving
everybody weak and exhausted. At night a damp breeze
sighed across the sand from the sea, soaking everything
as though it had rained. The busiest men in the camp
were the Vet. and the doctor.</p>

<p>Sand colic ran through the Division like a scourge,
and dysentery began to reduce the personnel from day
to day. The flies bred in their billions, in spite of all
the doctor’s efforts, loyally backed up by us. The
subalterns’ method of checking flies was to catch salamanders
and walk about, holding them within range of
guy ropes and tent roofs where flies swarmed, and watch
their coiled tongues uncurl like a flash of lightning and
then trace the passage of the disgruntled fly down into
the salamander’s interior. Battery Commanders waking
from a fly-pestered siesta would lay their piastres eagerly
on “Archibald” versus “Yussuf.” Even Wendy would
have admitted that it was “frightfully fascinating.”</p>

<p>Every morning there was a pyjama parade at six
o’clock when we all trooped across to the sea and went
in as nature made us. Or else we rode the horses with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
snorts and splashings. The old hairy enjoyed it as much
as we did and, once in, it was difficult to get him out
again, even with bare heels drumming on his ribs.</p>

<p>The infantry, instead of landing at Alexandria, had
gone straight to the Dardanelles, and after we had been
in camp about a fortnight the two senior brigades of
Gunners packed up and disappeared in the night, leaving
us grinding our teeth with envy and hoping that they
wouldn’t have licked the Turk until we got there too.</p>

<p>Five full months and a half we stayed in that camp!
One went through two distinct phases.</p>

<p>The first was good, when everything was new, different,
romantic, delightful, from the main streets of Alexandria
with European shops and Oriental people, the club with
its white-burnoused waiters with red sash and red fez,
down to the unutterable filth and foul smells of the back
streets where every disease lurked in the doorways.
There were early morning rides to sleepy villages across
the desert, pigeons fluttering round the delicate minarets,
one’s horse making scarcely any sound in the deep sand
until startled into a snort by a scuttling salamander
or iguana as long as one’s arm. Now and then one
watched breathless a string of camels on a distant skyline
disappearing into the vast silence. Then those dawns,
with opal colours like a rainbow that had broken open
and splashed itself across the world! What infinite joy
in all that riot of colour. The sunsets were too rapid:
one great splurge of blood and then darkness, followed
by a moonlight that was as hard as steel mirrors. Buildings
and trees were picked out in ghostly white but the
shadows by contrast were darker than the pit, made
gruesome by the howling of pariah dogs which flitted
silently like damned souls.</p>

<p>The eternal mystery of the yashmak caught us all,&mdash;two
deep eyes behind that little veil, the lilting, sensuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
walk, the perfect balance and rhythm of those women
who worshipped other gods.</p>

<p>Then there was the joy of mail day. Letters and
papers arrived regularly, thirteen days old but more
precious because of it. How one sprang to the mess-table
in the big marquee, open to whatever winds that
blew, when the letters were dumped on it, and danced
with impatience while they were being sorted, and retired
in triumph to one’s reed hut like a dog with a bone to
revel in all the little happenings at home that interested
us so vitally, to marvel at the amazingly different points
of view and to thank God that although thousands of
miles away one “belonged.”</p>

<p>Then came the time when we had explored everything,
knew it all backwards, and the colours didn’t
seem so bright. The sun seemed hotter, the flies thicker
and the days longer. Restlessness attacked everybody
and the question “What the devil are we doing here?”
began to be asked, only to draw bitter answers. Humour
began to have a tinge of sarcasm, remarks tended to become
personal and people disappeared precipitately after
mess instead of playing the usual rubbers. The unfortunate
subaltern who was the butt of the mess&mdash;a
really excellent and clever fellow&mdash;relapsed into a morose
silence, and every one who had the least tendency to
dysentery went gladly to hospital. Even the brigade
laughter-maker lost his touch. It had its echo in the
ranks. Sergeants made more frequent arrests, courts-martial
cropped up and it was more difficult to get the
work done in spite of concerts, sports and boxing contests.
Interest flagged utterly. Mercifully the Staff held
aloof.</p>

<p>The courts-martial seemed to me most Hogarthian
versions of justice, satirical and damnable. One in
particular was held on a poor little rat of an infantry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>man
who had missed the boat for Gallipoli and was
being tried for desertion. The reason of his missing
the boat was that she sailed before her time and he,
having had a glass or two&mdash;and why not?&mdash;found that
she had already gone when he arrived back in the harbour
five minutes before the official time for her departure.
He immediately reported to the police.</p>

<p>I am convinced that she was the only boat who
ever sailed before her time during the course of the
war!</p>

<p>However, I was under instruction&mdash;and learnt a great
deal. The heat was appalling. The poor little prisoner,
frightened out of his life, utterly lost his head, and the
Court, after hours of formal scribbling on blue paper,
brought him in guilty. Having obtained permission to
ask a question I requested to know whether the Court
was convinced that he had the intention of deserting.</p>

<p>The Court was quite satisfied on that point and, besides,
there had been so many cases of desertion lately from
the drafts for Gallipoli that really it was time an example
was made of some one. He got three years!</p>

<p>Supposing I’d hit that bullying sergeant in the eye in
Flanders?</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Two incidents occurred during that lugubrious period
that helped to break the dead monotony.</p>

<p>The first was the sight of a real live eunuch according
to all the specifications of the Arabian Nights. We were
to give a horse show and as the flag of residence was
flying from the Sultan’s palace I asked the Colonel if
I might invite the Sultan. The Colonel was quite in
favour of it. So with an extra polish on my buttons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and saddlery I collected a pal and together we rode
through the great gateway into the grounds of the
palace, ablaze with tropical vegetation and blood-red
flowers. Camped among the trees on the right of the
drive was a native guard of about thirty men. They
rose as one man, jabbered at the sight of us but remained
stationary. We rode on at a walk with all the dignity
of the British Empire behind us. Then we saw a big
Arab come running towards us from the palace, uttering
shrill cries and waving his arms. We met him and would
have passed but he made as though to lay hands upon
our bits. So we halted and listened to a stream of Arabic
and gesticulation.</p>

<p>Then the eunuch appeared, a little man of immense
shoulders and immense stomach, dressed in a black
frock coat and stiff white collar, yellow leather slippers
and red fez and sash. He was about five feet tall and
addressed us in a high squeaky voice like a fiddle string
out of tune. His dignity was surprising and he would
have done justice to the Court of Haroun al Raschid.
We were delighted with him and called him Morgiana.</p>

<p>He didn’t understand that so I tried him in French,
whereupon he clapped his hands twice, and from an
engine room among the outbuildings came running an
Arab mechanic in blue jeans. He spoke a sort of hybrid
Levantine French and conveyed our invitation of the
Sultan to the eunuch who bowed and spoke again. The
desire to laugh was appalling.</p>

<p>It appeared that the Sultan was absent in Alexandria
and only the Sultana and the ladies were here and it
was quite forbidden that we should approach nearer
the palace.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, therefore, we saluted, which drew many
salaams and bowings in reply, and rode away, followed
by that unforgettable little man’s squeaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>The other incident covered a period of a week or so.
It was a question of spies.</p>

<p>The village of Mamoura consisted of a railway terminus
and hotel round which sprawled a dark and smelly conglomeration
of hovels out of which sprouted the inevitable
minaret. The hotel was run by people who purported
to be French but who were of doubtful origin, ranging
from half-caste Arab to Turk by way of Greek and
Armenian Jew. But they provided dinner and cooling
drinks and it was pleasant to sit under the awninged
verandah and listen to the frogs and the sea or to play
their ramshackle piano and dance with the French residents
of Alexandria who came out for week-ends to
bathe.</p>

<p>At night we used to mount donkeys about as big as
large beetles and have races across the sands back to
camp, from which one could see the lights of the hotel.
Indeed we thought we saw what they didn’t intend us
to see, for there were unmistakable Morse flashings out
at sea from that cool verandah. We took it with grim
seriousness and lay for hours on our stomachs with
field glasses glued to our eyes. I posted my signalling
corporal in a drinking house next door to the hotel,
gave him late leave and paid his beer so that he might
watch with pencil and notebook. But always he reported
in the morning that he’d seen nothing.</p>

<p>The climax came when one night an orderly burst
into the hut which the Vet. and I shared and said, “Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; wants you to come over at once, sir. He’s taken
down half a message from the signalling at the hotel.”</p>

<p>I leapt into gum boots, snatched my glasses and ran
across to the sand mound from where we had watched.</p>

<p>The other subaltern was there in a great state of
excitement.</p>

<p>“Look at it,” he said. “Morsing like mad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>I looked,&mdash;and looked again.</p>

<p>There was a good breeze blowing and the flag on the
verandah was exactly like the shutter of a signalling
lamp!</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Having sat there all those months, the order to move,
when it did finally come, was of the most urgent nature.
It was received one afternoon at tea time and the next
morning before dawn we were marching down the canal
road.</p>

<p>Just before the end we had done a little training,
more to get the horses in draught than anything else.
With that and the horse shows it wasn’t at all a bad
turnout.</p>

<p>Once more we didn’t know for certain where we were
bound for, but the betting was about five to four on
Greece. How these things leak out is always a puzzle,
but leak out they do. Sure enough we made another
little sea voyage and in about three days steamed up the
Ægean, passing many boats loaded with odd looking
soldiers in khaki who turned out to be Greek, and at last
anchored outside Salonica in a mass of shipping, French
and English troopships, destroyers and torpedo boats
and an American battleship with Eiffel-tower masts.</p>

<p>From the sea Salonica was a flashing jewel in a perfect
setting. Minarets and mosques, white and red, sprouted
everywhere from the white, brown and green buildings.
Trees and gardens nestled within the crumbling old city
wall. Behind it ran a line of jagged peaks, merging
with the clouds, and here and there ran a little winding
ribbon of road, climbing up and up only to lose itself
suddenly by falling over a precipice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Here again the M.L.O. had not quite the Public School
and Varsity manner and we suffered accordingly. However,
they are a necessary evil presumably, these quayside
warriors. The proof undoubtedly lies in the number
of D.S.O.’s they muster,&mdash;&mdash;but I don’t remember to have
seen any of them with wound stripes. Curious, that.</p>

<p>We marched through mean streets, that smelled worse
than Egypt, and a dirty populace, poverty-stricken
and covered with sores; the soldiers in khaki that looked
like brown paper and leather equipments that were a
good imitation of cardboard. Most of the officers wore
spurs like the Three Musketeers and their little tin
swords looked as if they had come out of toy shops.
None of them were shaved. If first impressions count
for anything then God help the Greeks.</p>

<p>Our camp was a large open field some miles to the
north-west of the town on the lower slopes of a jagged
peak. The tinkle of cow bells made soft music everywhere.
Of accommodation there was none of any sort,
no tents, nothing but what we could improvise. The
Colonel slept under the lee of the cook’s cart. The
Adjutant and the doctor shared the Maltese cart and the
Vet. and I crept under the forage tarpaulin, from which
we were awakened in the dark by an unrestrained cursing
and the noise of a violent rainfall.</p>

<p>Needless to say everybody was soaked, fires wouldn’t
light, breakfast didn’t come, tempers as well as appetites
became extremely sharp and things were most unpleasant,&mdash;the
more so since it went on raining for three weeks
almost without stopping. Although we hadn’t seen
rain for half a year it didn’t take us five minutes to wish
we were back in Egypt. Fortunately we drew bell tents
within forty-eight hours and life became more bearable.
But once more we had to go through a sort of camp
drill by numbers,&mdash;odd numbers too, for the order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
came round that tents would be moved first, then vehicles,
and lastly the horses.</p>

<p>Presumably we had to move the guns and wagons
with drag-ropes while the horses watched us, grinning
into their nose bags.</p>

<p>Anyhow, there we were, half the artillery in Greece,
all eighteen-pounders, the other half and the infantry
somewhere in the Dardanelles. It appeared, however,
that the &mdash;&mdash; Division had quite a lot of perfectly good
infantry just up the road but their artillery hadn’t got
enough horses to go round. So we made a sort of Jack
Sprat and his wife arrangement and declared ourselves
mobile.</p>

<p>About four days after we’d come into camp the <i>Marquette</i>
was wrecked some thirty miles off Salonica. It
had the &mdash;&mdash; Divisional Ammunition Column on board
and some nurses. They had an appalling time in the
water and many were lost. The surviving officers,
who came dressed in the most motley garments, poor
devils, were split up amongst the brigade.</p>

<p>On the Headquarters Staff we took to our bosoms
a charming fellow who was almost immediately given
the name of Woodbine,&mdash;jolly old Woodbine, one of the
very best, whom we left behind with infinite regret while
we went up country. I’d like to know what his golf
handicap is these days.</p>

<p>The political situation was apparently delicate. Greece
was still sitting on the fence, waiting to see which way
the cat would jump, and here were we and our Allies,
the French, marching through their neutral country.</p>

<p>Slight evidences of the “delicacy” of the times were
afforded by the stabbing of some half dozen Tommies
in the dark streets of the town and by the fact that it
was only the goodly array of guns which prevented them
from interning us. I don’t think we had any ammuni<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>tion
as yet, so we couldn’t have done very much. However
that may be and whatever the political reasons,
we sat on the roadside day after day, watching the French
streaming up country,&mdash;infantry, field guns, mountain
artillery and pack transport,&mdash;heedless of Tino and his
protests. Six months in Egypt, and now this! We
<em>were</em> annoyed.</p>

<p>However, on about the twentieth day things really
happened. “Don” battery went off by train, their
destination being some unpronounceable village near the
firing line. We, the Headquarters Staff, and “AC”
battery followed the next day. The railway followed the
meanderings of the Vardar through fertile land of amazing
greenness and passed mountains of stark rock where
not even live oak grew. The weather was warm for
November, but that ceaseless rain put a damper on everything,
and when we finally arrived we found “Don”
battery sitting gloomily in a swamp on the side of the
road. We joined them.</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>The weather changed in the night and we were greeted
with a glorious sunshine in the morning that not only
dried our clothes but filled us with optimism.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn-97" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Just as were were'">
Just as we were</ins> about to start the pole of my G.S.
wagon broke. Everybody went on, leaving me in the
middle of nowhere with a broken wagon, no map, and
instructions to follow on to the “i” of Causli in a country
whose language I couldn’t speak and with no idea of the
distance. Fortunately I kept the brigade artificer with
me and a day’s bully beef and biscuits, for it was not till
two o’clock in the afternoon that we at last got that
wagon mended, having had to cut down a tree and make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
a new pole and drive rivets. Then we set off into the
unknown through the most glorious countryside imaginable.
The autumn had stained all the trees red and the
fallen leaves made a royal carpet. Vaguely I knew
the direction was north by east and once having struck
the road out of the village which led in that direction I
found that it went straight on through beds of streams,
between fields of maize and plantations of mulberries
and tumbled villages tenanted only by starving dogs.
The doors of nearly every house were splashed with a
blue cross,&mdash;reminiscences of a plague of typhus. From
time to time we met refugees trudging behind ox-drawn
wagons laden with everything they possessed in the world,
including their babies,&mdash;sad-faced, wild-looking peasants,
clad in picturesque rags of all colours with eyes that had
looked upon fear. I confess to having kept my revolver
handy. For all I knew they might be Turks, Bulgars
or at least brigands.</p>

<p>The sense of solitude was extraordinary. There was
no sign of an army on the march, not even a bully beef
tin to mark the route, nothing but the purple hills remaining
always far away and sending out a faint muttering
like the beating of drums heard in a dream. The road
ahead was always empty when I scanned it through
my glasses at hour intervals, the sun lower and lower
each time. Darkness came upon us as it did in Egypt,
as though some one had flicked off the switch. There
was no sign of the village which might be Causli and in
the dark the thought which had been uneasily twisting
in my brain for several hours suddenly found utterance
in the mouth of the artificer sergeant.</p>

<p>“D’you think we’re on the right road, sir?”</p>

<p>The only other road we could have taken was at the
very start. Ought I to have taken it? In any case there
was nothing to be done but go on until we met some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
one, French or English, but the feeling of uncertainty
was distinctly unpleasant. I sent the corporal on ahead
scouting and we followed silently, very stiff in the saddle.</p>

<p>At last I heard a shout, “Brigade ’Eadquarters?”
I think both the team drivers and myself answered
“Yes” together.</p>

<p>The corporal had found a guide sent out by the Adjutant,
who turned us off across fields and led us on to
another road, and round a bend we saw lights twinkling
and heard the stamp and movement of picketed horses
and answered the challenge of sentries. Dinner was
over, but the cook had kept some hot for me, and my
servant had rigged up my bivvy, a tiny canvas tent
just big enough to take a camp bed. As there was a
touch of frost I went to the bivvy to get a woollen scarf,
heard a scuffle, and saw two green eyes glaring at me.</p>

<p>I whipped out my revolver and flicked on an electric
torch. Crouched down on the bed was a little tortoise-shell
kitten so thin that every rib stood out and even
more frightened than I was. I caught it after a minute.
It was ice cold so I tucked it against my chest under the
British warm and went to dinner. After about five
minutes it began to purr and I fed it with some bits of
meat which it bolted ravenously. It followed that up
by standing in a saucer of milk, growling furiously and
lapping for dear life. Friendship was established. It
slept in the British warm, purring savagely when I
stroked it, as though starved of affection as well as food;
followed close to my heels when I went out in the morning
but fled wildly back to the bivvy if any one came up to
me, emerging arched like a little caterpillar from under
the bed, uttering cries of joy when I lifted the bivvy flap.</p>

<p>It was almost like finding a refugee child who had
got frightened and lost and trusted only the hand that
had done it a kindness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>The “i” of Causli showed itself in the morning to be
a stretch of turf in a broad green trough between two
rows of steep hills. Causli was somewhere tucked
behind the crest in our rear and the road on which I
had travelled ran back a couple of miles, doubled in a
hairpin twist and curved away on the other side of the
valley until it lost itself behind a belt of trees that leaped
out of the far hill. Forward the view was shut in by the
spur which sheltered us, but our horses were being saddled
and after breakfast the Colonel took me with him to
reconnoitre. Very soon the valley ceased and the road
became a mountain path with many stone bridges taking
it over precipitous drops. Looking over, one saw little
streams bubbling in the sunlight. After about three
miles of climbing we came upon a signal station on the
roadside with linesmen at work. It was the first sign
of any troops in all that country, but miles behind us,
right back to Salonica, the road was a long chain of troops
and transport. Our brigade was as yet the only one
up in action.</p>

<p>The signal station proved to be infantry headquarters.
It was the summit of the pass, the mountains opening
like a great V in front through which further mountains
appeared, with that one endless road curling up
like a white snake. There was a considerable noise
of firing going on and we were just in time to see the
French take a steep crest,&mdash;an unbelievable sight. We
lay on our stomachs miles behind them and through
glasses watched puffs of cotton wool, black and white,
sprout out of a far-away hill, followed by a wavering line
of blue dots. Presently the cotton wool sprouted closer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
to the crest and the blue dots climbed steadily. Then
the cotton wool disappeared over the top and the blue
dots gave chase. Now and then one stumbled and fell.
Breathless one watched to see if he would get up again.
Generally he didn’t, but the line didn’t stop and presently
the last of it had disappeared over the crest. The invisible
firing went on and the only proof that it wasn’t
a dream was the motionless bundles of blue that lay out
there in the sun.&mdash;</p>

<p>It was the first time I’d seen men killed and it left
me silent, angry. Why “go out” like that on some
damned Serbian hill? What was it all about that
everybody was trying to kill everybody else? Wasn’t
the sun shining and the world beautiful? What was
this disease that had broken out like a scab over the
face of the world?&mdash;why did those particular dots have
to fall? Why not the ones a yard away? What
was the law of selection? Was there a law? <em>Did</em>
every bullet have its billet? Was there a bullet for the
Colonel?&mdash;For <em>me</em>?&mdash;No. It was impossible! But
then, why those others and which of us?&mdash;</p>

<p>I think I’ve found the answer to some of those questions
now. But on that bright November day, 1915, I
was too young. It was all in the game although from
that moment there was a shadow on it.</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>“Don” battery went into action first.</p>

<p>The Headquarters moved up close to the signalling
station&mdash;and I lost my kitten&mdash;but “Don” went down
the pass to the very bottom and cross-country to the
east, and dug themselves in near a deserted farmhouse
on the outskirts of Valandovo. “Beer” and “C”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
batteries came up a day or two later and sat down
with “AC.” There seemed to be no hurry. Our own
infantry were not in the line. They were in support
of the French and with supine ignorance or amazing
pluck, but anyhow a total disregard of the laws of warfare,
proceeded to dig trenches of sorts in full daylight
and in full view of the Bulgar. We shouldn’t have
minded so much but our O.P. happened to be on the hill
where most of these heroes came to dig.</p>

<p>The troops themselves were remarkably ill-chosen.
Most of those who were not Irish were flat-footed
“brickees” from Middlesex, Essex and the dead-level
east coast counties, so their own officers told me, where
they never raise one ankle above the other. Now they
were chosen to give imitations of chamois in these endless
hills. Why not send an aviator to command a tank?
Furthermore, the only guns were French 75’s and our
eighteen-pounders and, I think, a French brigade of
mountain artillery, when obviously howitzers were indicated.
And there were no recuperators in those days.
Put a quadrant angle of 28° and some minutes on an old
pattern eighteen-pounder and see how long you stay
in action,&mdash;with spare springs at a premium and the
nearest workshops sixty miles away. My own belief
is that a couple of handfuls of Gurkhas and French
Tirailleurs would have cleaned up Serbia in a couple of
months. As it was...&mdash;</p>

<p>The French gave us the right of the line from north-west
of Valandovo to somewhere east of Kajali in the
blue hills, over which, said the Staff, neither man nor
beast could pass. We needn’t worry about our right,
they said. Nature was doing that for us. But apparently
Nature had allowed not less than eight Greek
divisions to march comfortably over that impassable
right flank of ours in the previous Græco-Bulgarian dust-up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Of course the Staff didn’t find it out till afterwards.
It only cost us a few thousand dead and the Staff were
all right in Salonica, so there was no great harm done!
Till then the thing was a picnic. On fine mornings
the Colonel and I rode down the pass to see Don battery,
climbed the mountain to the stone sangar which was
their O.P. and watched them shoot&mdash;they were a joyous
unshaven crowd&mdash;went on down the other side to the
French front line and reconnoitred the country for
advanced positions and generally got the hang of things.</p>

<p>As I knew French there were occasions when I was
really useful, otherwise it was simply a joy-ride for me
until the rest of the batteries came into action. One
morning the Colonel and I were right forward watching
a heavy barrage on a village occupied by the Bulgar.
The place selected by the Colonel from which to enjoy
a really fine view was only ten yards from a dead Bulgar
who was in a kneeling position in a shallow trench with
his hands in his pockets, keeled over at an angle. He’d
been there many days and the wind blew our way. But
the Colonel had a cold. I fled to a flank. While we
watched, two enemy batteries opened. For a long time
we tried to locate their flash. Then we gave it up and
returned up the pass to where a French battery was
tucked miraculously among holly bushes just under the
crest. One of their officers was standing on the sky
line, also endeavouring to locate those new batteries.
So we said we’d have another try, climbed up off the road,
lay upon our stomachs and drew out our glasses. Immediately
a pip-squeak burst in the air about twenty
yards away. Another bracketed us and the empty shell
went whining down behind us. I thought it was rather
a joke and but for the Colonel would have stayed there.</p>

<p>He, however, was a regular Gunner, thank God, and
slithered off the mound like an eel. I followed him like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
his shadow and we tucked ourselves half crouching,
half sitting, under the ledge, with our feet on the road.
For four hours the Bulgar tried to get that French
battery. If he’d given five minutes more right he’d
have done it,&mdash;and left us alone. As it was he plastered
the place with battery fire every two seconds.&mdash;Shrapnel
made pockmarks in the road, percussion bursts filled our
necks with dirt from the ledge and ever the cases
whined angrily into the ravine. We smoked many
pipes.</p>

<p>It was my first experience under shell fire. I found
it rather like what turning on the quarter current in
the electric chair must be,&mdash;most invigorating, but a
little jumpy. One never knew. Thank heaven they
were only pip-squeaks. During those crouching hours
two French poilus walked up the pass&mdash;it was impossible
to go quickly because it was so steep&mdash;and without
turning a hair or attempting to quicken or duck walked
through that barrage with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sangfroid</i> that left me gasping.
Although in a way I was enjoying it, I was mighty glad
to be under that ledge, and my heart thumped when the
Colonel decided to make a run for it and went on thumping
till we were a good thousand yards to a flank.</p>

<p>The worst of it was, it was the only morning that
I hadn’t brought sandwiches.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>When the other three batteries went into action and
the ammunition column tucked itself into dry nullahs
along the road we moved up into Valandovo and established
Brigade Headquarters in a farmhouse and for many
days the signallers and I toiled up and down mountains,
laying air lines. It was an elementary sort of war.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
There were not balloons, no aeroplanes and camouflage
didn’t seem to matter. Infantry pack transport went
up and down all day long. It was only in the valley
that the infantry were able to dig shallow trenches.
On the hills they built sangars, stone breastwork affairs.
Barbed wire I don’t remember to have seen. There
were no gas shells, no 5.9’s, nothing bigger than pip-squeaks.
The biggest artillery the Allies possessed
were two 120-centimetre guns called respectively Crache
Mort and Chasse Boche. One morning two Heavy
Gunners blew in and introduced themselves as being
on the hunt for sixty-pounder positions. They were
burning to lob some over into Strumnitza. We assisted
them eagerly in their reconnaissance and they went
away delighted, promising to return within three days.
They were still cursing on the quayside when we came
limping back to Salonica. Apparently there was no
one qualified to give them the order to come up and
help. In those days Strumnitza was the Bulgar rail-head,
and they could have pounded it to bits.</p>

<p>As it was, our brigade was the only English Gunner
unit in action, and the Battery Commanders proved
conclusively to the French (and the Bulgar) that the
eighteen-pounder was a handy little gun. The French
General ordered one of the 75 batteries to advance to
Kajali. They reconnoitred the hills and reported that
it was impossible without going ten miles round. The
General came along to see for himself and agreed. The
Captain of “C” battery, however, took a little walk
up there and offered to get up if the Colonel would lend
him a couple of hundred infantry. At the same time
he pointed out that coming down in a hurry was another
story, absolutely impossible. However, it was discussed
by the powers that were and the long and short
of it was that two of our batteries were ordered forward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
“C” was the pioneer; and with the two hundred
infantry,&mdash;horses were out of the question&mdash;and all
the gunners they laboured from 4.30 p.m. to 6 a.m.
the next morning, at which hour they reported themselves
in action again. It was a remarkable feat, brought about
by sheer muscle and will power, every inch of the way a
battle, up slopes that were almost vertical, over small
boulders, round big ones with straining drag ropes for
about two miles and a half. The 75’s refused to believe
it until they had visited the advanced positions. They
bowed and said “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Touché!</span>”</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Then the snow came in blinding blizzards that blotted
out the whole world and everybody went underground
and lived in overcoats and stoked huge fires,&mdash;everybody
except the infantry whose rifle bolts froze stiff,
whose rations didn’t arrive and who could only crouch
behind their stone sangars. The cold was intense and
they suffered terribly. When the blizzard ceased after
about forty-eight hours the tracks had a foot of
snow over them and the drifts were over one’s
head.</p>

<p>Even in our little farmhouse where the Colonel and I
played chess in front of a roaring fire, drinks froze solid
on the mantelpiece and we remained muffled to the eyes.
Thousands of rock pigeons appeared round the horse
lines, fighting for the dropped grain, and the starving
dogs became so fierce and bold that it was only wise to
carry a revolver in the deserted villages. Huge brutes
some of them, the size of Arab donkeys, a cross between
a mastiff and a great Dane. Under that clean garment
of snow which didn’t begin to melt for a fortnight, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
country was of an indescribable beauty. Every leaf
on the trees bore its little white burden, firm and crisp,
and a cold sun appeared and threw most wonderful
lights and shadows. The mountains took on a virgin
purity.</p>

<p>But to the unfortunate infantry it was one long stretch
of suffering. Hundreds a day came down on led mules
in an agonised string, their feet bound in straw, their
faces and hands blue like frozen meat. The hospitals
were full of frost-bite cases, and dysentery was not
unknown in the brigade. Pot-face in particular behaved
like a hero. He had dysentery very badly but absolutely
refused to let the doctor send him down.</p>

<p>Our rations were none too good, and there were interminable
spells of bully beef, fried, hashed, boiled, rissoled,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au naturel</i> with pickles, and bread became a luxury.
We reinforced this with young maize which grew everywhere
in the valley and had wonderful soup and corn
on the cob, boiled in tinned milk and then fried. Then
too the Vet. and I had a wonderful afternoon’s wild bull
hunting with revolvers. We filled the wretched animal
with lead before getting near enough to give the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de
grâce</i> beside a little stream. The Vet. whipped off
his tunic, turned up his sleeves and with a long trench
knife conducted a masterly post mortem which resulted
in about forty pounds of filet mignon. The next morning
before dawn the carcase was brought in in the cook’s
cart and the Headquarters Staff lived on the fat of the
land and invited all the battery commanders to the
discussion of that excellent bull.</p>

<p>From our point of view it wasn’t at all a bad sort of
war. We hadn’t had a single casualty. The few rounds
which ever came anywhere near the batteries were greeted
with ironic cheers and the only troubles with telephone
lines were brought about by our own infantry who re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>moved
lengths of five hundred yards or so presumably
to mend their bivvies with.</p>

<p>But about the second week of December indications
<ins class="corr" id="tn-108" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'were not wanted'">
were not wanting</ins> of hostile activity. Visibility was very
bad owing to early morning fogs, but odd rounds began
to fall in the valley behind us in the neighbourhood
of the advancing wagon lines, and we fired on infantry
concentrations and once even an S.O.S. Rifle fire began
to increase and stray bullets hummed like bees on the
mountain paths.</p>

<p>In the middle of this I became ill with a temperature
which remained for four days in the neighbourhood
of 104°. The doctor talked of hospital but I’d never
seen the inside of one and didn’t want to.</p>

<p>However, on the fourth day it was the Colonel’s order
that I should go. It transpired afterwards that the
doctor diagnosed enteric. So away I went labelled and
wrapped up in a four-mule ambulance wagon. The cold
was intense, the road appalling, the pip-squeaks not too
far away until we got out of the valley, and the agony
unprintable. That night was spent in a Casualty Clearing
Station in the company of half a dozen infantry
subalterns all splashed with blood.</p>

<p>At dawn next morning when we were in a hospital
train on our way to Salonica, the attack began. The
unconsidered right flank was the trouble. Afterwards
I heard about a dozen versions of the show, all much the
same in substance. The Bulgars poured over the right
in thousands, threatening to surround us. Some of the
infantry put up a wonderful fight. Others&mdash;didn’t.
Our two advanced batteries fired over open sights into
the brown until they had exhausted their ammunition,
then removed breech blocks and dial sights, destroyed
the pieces and got out, arming themselves with rifles
and ammunition picked up <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad lib.</span> on the way down.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
“Don” and “AC” went out of one end of the village
of Valandovo while the enemy were held up at the
other by the Gunners of the other two batteries. Then
two armies, the French and English, got tangled up in
the only road of retreat, engineers hastening the stragglers
and then blowing up bridges. “Don” and “AC”
filled up with ammunition and came into action in support
of the other brigades at Causli which now opened
fire while “Beer” and “C” got mounted and chased
those of our infantry who “didn’t,” rounded them up,
and marched them back to face the enemy. Meanwhile
I was tucked away in a hospital bed in a huge marquee,
trying to get news from every wounded officer who was
brought in. The wildest rumours were going about
but no one knew anything officially. I heard that the
infantry were wiped out, that the gunners had all been
killed or captured to a man, that the remnants of the
French were fighting desperately and that the whole
thing was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débâcle</i>.</p>

<p>There we all were helpless in bed, with nurses looking
after us, splendid English girls, and all the time those
infernal guns coming nearer and nearer.&mdash;At night,
sleepless and in a fever, one could almost hear the rumble
of their wheels, and from the next tent where the wounded
Tommies lay in rows, one or two would suddenly scream
in their agony and try and stifle their sobs, calling on
Jesus Christ to kill them and put them out of their pain.&mdash;</p>

<p>The brigade, when I rejoined, was in camp east of
Salonica, under the lee of Hortiac, knee-deep in mud and
somewhat short of kit. It was mighty good to get back
and see them in the flesh again, after all those rumours
which had made one sick with apprehension.</p>

<p>Having pushed us out of Serbia into Greece the Bulgar
contented himself with sitting on the frontier and making
rude remarks. The Allies, however, silently dug them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>selves
in and prepared for the defence of Salonica in
case he should decide to attack again. The Serbs retired
to Corfu to reform, and although Tino did a considerable
amount of spluttering at this time, the only sign of interest
the Greeks showed was to be more insolent in the
streets.</p>

<p>We drew tents and moved up into the hills and Woodbine
joined us again, no longer a shipwrecked mariner
in clothes off the peg, but in all the glory of new uniform
and breeches out from home, a most awful duke. Pot-face
and the commander of “C” battery went to hospital
shortly afterwards and were sent home. Some of the
Brass Hats also changed rounds. One, riding forth from
a headquarters with cherry brandy and a fire in each
room, looked upon our harness immediately on our
return from the retreat and said genially that he’d heard
that we were a “rabble.” When, however, the commander
of “Don” battery asked him for the name and
regiment of his informant, the Brass Hat rode away
muttering uncomfortably. Things were a little strained!</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>However, Christmas was upon us so we descended
upon the town with cook’s carts and visited the Base
cashier. Salonica was a modern Babel. The cobbles
of the Rue Venizelos rang with every tongue in the world,&mdash;Turkish,
Russian, Yiddish, Serbian, Spanish, Levantine,
Arabic, English, French, Italian, Greek and even
German. Little tin swords clattered everywhere and the
place was a riot of colour, the Jew women with green
pearl-sewn headdresses, the Greek peasants in their
floppy-seated trousers elbowing enormous Russian soldiers
in loose blouses and jack boots who in turn elbowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
small-waisted Greek highlanders in kilts with puffballs
on their curly-toed shoes. There were black-robed
priests with long beards and high hats, young men in
red fezzes, civilians in bowlers, old hags who gobbled
like turkeys and snatched cigarette ends, all mixed up
in a kaleidoscopic jumble with officers of every country
and exuding a smell of garlic, fried fish, decaying vegetable
matter, and those aromatic eastern dishes which fall
into no known category of perfume. Fling into this
chaos numbers of street urchins of untold dirt chasing
turkeys and chickens between one’s legs and you get
a slight idea of what sort of place we came to to do our
Christmas shopping.</p>

<p>The best known language among the shopkeepers was
Spanish, but French was useful and after hours of struggling
one forced a passage out of the crowd with barrels
of beer, turkey, geese, pigs, fruit and cigarettes for the
men, and cigars and chocolates, whisky, Grand Marnier
and Cointreau for the mess. Some fund or other had
decided that every man was to have a plum pudding,
and these we had drawn from the A.S.C. on Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p>In Egypt letters had taken thirteen days to arrive.
Here they took from fifteen to seventeen, sometimes
twenty-one. Christmas Day, however, was one of the
occasions when nothing came at all and we cursed the
unfortunate post office in chorus. I suppose it’s the
streak of childhood in every man of us that makes us
want our letters <em>on</em> the day. So the morning was a little
chilly and lonely until we went round to see that the
men’s dinner was all right. It was, with lashings of beer.</p>

<p>This second Christmas on active service was a tremendous
contrast to the first. Then there was the service
in the barn followed by that depressing lonely day in
the fog and flat filth of Flanders. Now there was a clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
sunny air and a gorgeous view of purple mountains with
a glimpse of sea far off below.</p>

<p>In place of Mass in the barn Woodbine and I went for
a walk and climbed up to the white Greek church above
the village, surrounded by cloisters in which shot up
cypress trees, the whole picked out in relief against the
brown hill. We went in. The church was empty
but for three priests, one on the altar behind the screen,
one in a pulpit on each side in the body of the church.
For a long time we stood there listening as they flung
prayers and responses from one to another in a high,
shrill, nasal minor key that had the wail of lost souls
in it. It was most un-Christmassy and we came out
with a shiver into the sun.</p>

<p>Our guest at dinner that night was a Serbian liaison
officer from Divisional Headquarters. We stuffed him
with the usual British food and regaled him with many
songs to the accompaniment of the banjo and broke
up still singing in the small hours but not having quite
cured the ache in our hearts caused by “absent friends.”</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>The second phase of the campaign was one of endless
boredom, filthy weather and the nuisance of changing
camp every other month. The boredom was only
slightly relieved by a few promotions, two or three full
lieutenants becoming captains and taking command
of the newly arranged sections of D.A.C., and a few second
lieutenants getting their second pip. I was one. The
weather was characteristic of the country, unexpected,
violent. About once a week the heavens opened themselves.
Thunder crashed round in circles in a black
sky at midday, great tongues of lightning lit the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
world in shuddering flashes. The rain made every
nullah a roaring waterfall with three or four feet of muddy
water racing down it and washing away everything in
its path. The trenches round our bell tents were of
little avail against such violence. The trench sides
dissolved and the water poured in. These storms lasted
an hour or two and then the sky cleared almost as quickly
as it had darkened and the mountain peaks gradually
appeared again, clean and fresh. On one such occasion,
but much later in the year, the Adjutant was caught
riding up from Salonica on his horse and a thunderbolt
crashed to earth about thirty yards away from him. The
horse stood trembling for full two minutes and then
galloped home in a panic.</p>

<p>The changing of camps seemed to spring from only
one reason,&mdash;the desire for “spit and polish” which
covers a multitude of sins. It doesn’t matter if your
gunners are not smart at gun drill or your subalterns
in utter ignorance of how to lay out lines of fire and
make a fighting map. So long as your gun park is
aligned to the centimetre, your horse lines supplied
conspicuously with the type of incinerator fancied by
your Brigadier-General and the whole camp liberally
and tastefully decorated with white stones,&mdash;then you
are a crack brigade, and Brass Hats ride round you with
oily smiles and pleasant remarks and recommend each
other for decorations.</p>

<p>But adopt your own incinerator (infinitely more
practical as a rule than the Brigadier-General’s) and let
yourself be caught with an untidy gun park and your
life becomes a hell on earth. We learnt it bitterly,
until at last the Adjutant used to ride ahead with the
R.S.M., a large fatigue party and several miles of string
and mark the position of every gun muzzle and wagon
wheel in the brigade. And when the storms broke and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
washed away the white stones the Adjutant would dash
out of his tent immediately the rain ceased, calling upon
God piteously, the R.S.M. irritably, and every man in
the brigade would collect other stones for dear life.</p>

<p>Time hung very heavy. The monotony of week
after week of brigade fatigues, standing gun drill, exercising
and walking horses, inspecting the men’s dinners,
with nothing to do afterwards except play cards, read,
write letters and curse the weather, and the war and
all Brass Hats. Hot baths in camp were, as usual, as
diamonds in oysters. Salonica was about twelve miles
away for a bath, a long weary ride mostly at a walk on
account of the going. But it was good to ride in past
the village we used to call Peacockville, for obvious
reasons, put the horses up in a Turkish stable in a back
street in Salonica, and bathe and feed at the “Tour
Blanche,” and watch the crowd. It was a change, at
least, from the eternal sameness of camp and the cramped
discomfort of bell tents, and there was always a touch
of mystery and charm in the ride back in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The whole thing seemed so useless, such an utter
waste of life. There one sat in the mud doing nothing.
The war went on and we weren’t helping. All our civil
ambitions and hopes were withering under our very
eyes. One hopeless dawn succeeded another. I tried
to write, but my brain was like a sponge dipped into
khaki dye. One yearned for France, where at least
there was fighting and leave, or if not leave then the
hourly chance of a “blighty” wound.</p>

<p>About April there came a welcome interlude. The
infantry had also chopped and changed, and been moved
about and in the intervals had been kept warm and
busy in digging a chain of defences in a giant hundred-mile
half-circle around Salonica, the hub of our existence.
The weather still didn’t seem to know quite what it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
wanted to do. There was a hint of spring but it varied
between blinding snow-storms, bursts of warm sun and
torrents of rain.</p>

<p>“Don” battery had been moved to Stavros in the
defensive chain, and the Colonel was to go down and do
Group Commander. The Adjutant was left to look after
the rest of the brigade. I went with the Colonel to do
Adjutant in the new group. So we collected a handful
of signallers, a cart with our kits and servants, and set
out on a two-day trek due east along the line of lakes
to the other coast.</p>

<p>The journey started badly in a howling snow-storm.
To reach the lake level there was a one-way pass that
took an hour to go down, and an hour and a half to
climb on the return trip. The Colonel went on ahead
to see the General. I stayed with the cart and fought
my way through the blizzard. At the top of the pass
was a mass of Indian transport. We all waited for
two hours, standing still in the storm, the mud belly-deep
because some unfortunate wagon had got stuck in
the ascent. I remember having words with a Captain
who sat hunched on his horse like a sack the whole two
hours and refused to give an order or lend a hand when
every one of his teams jibbed, when at last the pass was
declared open. God knows how he ever got promoted.</p>

<p>However, we got down at last and the sun came out
and dried us. I reported to the Colonel, and we went
on in a warm golden afternoon along the lake shore
with ducks getting up out of the rushes in hundreds,
and, later, woodcock flashing over our heads on their
way to water. As far as I remember the western lake
is some eight miles long and about three wide at its widest
part, with fairy villages nestling against the purple
mountain background, the sun glistening on the
minarets and the faint sound of bells coming across the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
water. We spent the night as guests of a battery which
we found encamped on the shore, and on the following
morning trekked along the second lake, which is about
ten miles in length, ending at a jagged mass of rock and
thick undergrowth which had split open into a wild,
wooded ravine with a river winding its way through the
narrow neck to the sea, about five miles farther on.</p>

<p>We camped in the narrow neck on a sandy bay by the
river, rock shooting up sheer from the back of the tents,
the horses hidden under the trees. The Colonel’s command
consisted of one 60-pounder&mdash;brought round by
sea and thrown into the shallows by the Navy, who said
to us, “Here you are, George. She’s on terra firma.
It’s up to you now”&mdash;two naval 6-inch, one eighteen-pounder
battery, “Don,” one 4.5 howitzer battery, and
a mountain battery, whose commander rode about on a
beautiful white mule with a tail trimmed like an hotel
bell pull. “AC” battery of ours came along a day or
two later to join the merry party, because, to use the
vulgar but expressive phrase, the Staff “got the wind
up,” and saw Bulgars behind every tree.</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>In truth it was a comedy,&mdash;though there were elements
of tragedy in the utter inefficiency displayed. We rode
round to see the line of our zone. It took two days,
because, of course, the General had to get back to lunch.
Wherever it was possible to cut tracks, tracks had been
cut, beautiful wide ones, making an enemy advance easy.
They were guarded by isolated machine-gun posts at
certain strategic points, and in the nullahs was a little
barbed wire driven in on wooden stakes. Against the
barbed wire, however, were piled masses of dried thorn,&mdash;utterly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
impassable but about as inflammable as gun-powder.
This was all up and down the wildest country.
If a massacre had gone on fifty yards to our right or left
at any time, we shouldn’t have been able to see it. And
the line of infantry was so placed that it was impossible
to put guns anywhere to assist them.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that although I have two eyes,
two ears, and a habit of looking and listening, I was only
a lieutenant with two pips in those days, and therefore
my opinion is not, of course, worth the paper it is written
on. Ask any Brass Hat!</p>

<p>An incident comes back to me of the action before
the retreat. I had only one pip then. Two General
Staffs wished to make a reconnaissance. I went off at
3 a.m. to explore a short way, got back at eight o’clock,
after five hours on a cold and empty stomach, met the
Staffs glittering in the winter sun, and led them up a goat
track, ridable, of course. They left the horses eventually,
and I brought them to the foot of the crest, from which
the reconnaissance was desired. The party was some
twenty strong, and walked up on to the summit and
produced many white maps. I was glad to sit down,
and did so under the crest against a rock. Searching the
opposite sky line with my glasses, I saw several parties
of Bulgars watching us,&mdash;only recognisable as Bulgars
because the little of them that I could see moved from
time to time. The Colonel was near me and I told him.
He took a look and went up the crest and told the
Staffs. The Senior Brass Hat said, “Good God! What
are you all doing up here on the crest? Get under cover
at once,”&mdash;and he and they all hurried down. The
reconnaissance was over!</p>

<p>On leading them a short way back to the horses (it
saved quite twenty minutes’ walk) it became necessary
to pass through a wet, boggy patch about four yards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
across. The same Senior Brass Hat stopped at the edge
of it, and said to me, “What the devil did you bring us
this way for? You don’t expect me to get my boots
dirty, do you?&mdash;Good God!”</p>

<p>I murmured something about active service,&mdash;but,
as I say, I had only one pip then.&mdash;</p>

<p>It isn’t that one objects to being cursed. The thing
that rankles is to have to bend the knee to a system
whose slogan is efficiency, but which retains the doddering
and the effete in high commands simply because they
have a quarter of a century of service to their records.
The misguided efforts of these dodderers are counteracted
to a certain extent by the young, keen men under
them. But it is the dodderers who get the credit, while
the real men lick their boots and have to kowtow in the
most servile manner. Furthermore, it is no secret.
We know it and yet we let it go on: and if to-day there
are twenty thousand unnecessary corpses among our
million dead, after all, what are they among so many?
The dodderers have still got enough life to parade at
Buckingham Palace and receive another decoration, and
we stand in the crowd and clap our hands, and say,
“Look at old so-and-so! Isn’t he a grand old man?
Must be seventy-six if he’s a day!”</p>

<p>So went the comedy at Stavros. One Brass Hat
dug a defence line at infinite expense and labour. Along
came another, just a pip senior, looked round and said,
“Good God! You’ve dug in the wrong place.&mdash;Must
be scrapped.” And at more expense and more labour
a new line was dug. And then a third Brass Hat came
along and it was all to do over again. Men filled the
base hospitals and died of dysentery; the national
debt added a few more insignificant millions,&mdash;and the
Brass Hats went on leave to Alexandria for a well-earned
rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Not only at Stavros did this happen, but all round
the half circle in the increasingly hot weather, as the
year became older and disease more rampant.</p>

<p>After we’d been down there a week and just got the
hang of the country another Colonel came and took over
the command of the group, so we packed up our traps
and having bagged many woodcock and duck, went away,
followed after a few days by “AC” and “Don.”</p>

<p>About that time, to our lasting grief, we lost our
Colonel, who went home. It was a black day for the
brigade. His thoughtfulness for every officer under
him, his loyalty and unfailing cheeriness had made him
much loved. I, who had ridden with him daily, trekked
the snowy hills in his excellent company, played chess
with him, strummed the banjo while he chanted half-remembered
songs, shared the same tent with him on
occasions and appreciated to the full his unfailing kindness,
mourned him as my greatest friend. The day he
went I took my last ride with him down to the rest camp
just outside Salonica, a wild, threatening afternoon,
with a storm which burst on me in all its fury as
I rode back miserably, alone.</p>

<p>In due course his successor came and we moved to
Yailajik&mdash;well called by the men, Yellow-Jack&mdash;and
the hot weather was occupied with training schemes at
dawn, officers’ rides and drills, examinations A and B
(unofficial, of course), horse shows and an eternity of
unnecessary work, while one gasped in shirt sleeves
and stupid felt hats after the Anzac pattern; long,
long weeks of appalling heat and petty worries, until it
became a toss-up between suicide or murder. The whole
spirit of the brigade changed. From having been a
happy family working together like a perfect team, the
spirit of discontent spread like a canker. The men looked
sullen and did their work grudgingly, going gladly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
hospital at the first signs of dysentery. Subalterns put
in applications for the Flying Corps,&mdash;I was one of their
number,&mdash;and ceased to take an interest in their sections.
Battery Commanders raised sarcasm to a fine art, and
cursed the day that ever sent them to this ghastly back-water.</p>

<p>I left the headquarters and sought relief in “C”
battery, where, encouraged by the sympathetic commanding
officer, I got nearer to the solution of the mysterious
triangle T.O.B. than I’d ever been before. He had a
way of talking about it that the least intelligent couldn’t
fail to grasp.</p>

<p>At last I fell ill and with an extraordinary gladness
went down to the 5th Canadian hospital, on the eastern
outskirts of Salonica, on the seashore. The trouble
was an ear. Even the intensest pain, dulled by frequent
injections of morphia, did not affect my relief in getting
away from that brigade, where, up to the departure of
the Colonel, I had spent such a happy time. The pity
of it was that everybody envied me.</p>

<p>They talked of an operation. Nothing would have
induced me to let them operate in that country where
the least scratch turned septic. After several weeks I
was sent to Malta, where I was treated for twenty-one
days. At the end of that time the specialist asked me
if my career would be interfered with if he sent me home
for consultation as to an operation. One reason he could
not do it was that it was a long business, six weeks in
bed, at least, and they were already overfull. The
prison door was about to open! I assured him that on
the contrary my career would benefit largely by a sight
of home, and to my eternal joy he then and there, in
rubber gloves, wrote a recommendation to send me
to England. His name stands out in my memory in
golden letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours I was on board.</p>

<p>The fact that all my kit was still with the battery was
a matter of complete indifference. I would have left
a thousand kits. At home all the leaves were turning,
blue smoke was filtering out of red chimneys against
the copper background of the beech woods&mdash;and they
would be waiting for me in the drive.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-capy">England had changed in the eighteen months
since we put out so joyously from Avonmouth.
Munition factories were in full blast, food restrictions
in force, women in all kinds of uniforms, London in
utter darkness at night, the country dotted with hutted
training camps. Everything was quiet. We had taken
a nasty knock or two and washed some of our dirty linen
in public, not too clean at that. My own lucky star
was in the ascendant. The voyage completely cured
me, and within a week I was given a month’s sick leave
by the Medical Board,&mdash;a month of heaven more nearly
describes it, for I passed my days in a state of bliss which
nothing could mar, except perhaps the realisation, <ins class="corr" id="tn-125" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to-towards the end'">
towards the end</ins>, of the fact that I had to go back and
settle into the collar again.</p>

<p>My mental attitude towards the war had changed.
Whatever romance and glamour there may have been
had worn off. It was just one long bitter waste of time,&mdash;our
youth killed like flies by “dug-outs,” at the front,
so that old men and sick might carry on the race, while
profiteers drew bloated profits and politicians exuded
noxious gas in the House. Not a comforting point of
view to take back into harness. I was told on good
authority that to go out to France in a field battery
was a certain way of finding death. They were being
flung away in the open to take another thousand yards
of trench, so as to make a headline in the daily papers
which would stir the drooping spirits of the old, the sick,
and the profiteer over their breakfast egg. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embusqué</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
was enjoying those headlines too. The combing-out
process had not yet begun. The young men who had
never been out of England were Majors and Colonels
in training camps. It was the officers who returned to
duty from hospital, more or less cured of wounds or
sickness, who were the first to be sent out again. The
others knew a thing or two.</p>

<p>That was how it struck me when I was posted to a
reserve brigade just outside London.</p>

<p>Not having the least desire to be “flung away in the
open,” I did my best to get transferred to a 6-inch
battery. The Colonel of the reserve brigade did his
best, but it was queered at once, without argument or
appeal, by the nearest Brass Hat, in the following
manner. The Colonel having signed and recommended
the formal application, spoke to the General personally
on my behalf.</p>

<p>“What sort of a fellow is he?” asked the General.</p>

<p>“Seems a pretty useful man,” said the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll keep him,” said the General.</p>

<p>“The pity of it is,” said the Colonel to me later, “that
if I’d said you were a hopeless damned fool, he would
have signed it.”</p>

<p>On many subsequent occasions the Colonel flung
precisely that expression at me so he might just as well
have said it then.</p>

<p>However, as it seemed that I was destined for a short
life, I determined to make it as merry as possible, and
in the company of a kindred spirit, who was posted from
hospital a couple of days after I was, and who is now a
Bimbashi in the Soudan, I went up to town about three
nights a week, danced and did a course of theatres. By
day there was no work to do as the brigade already had
far too many officers, none of whom had been out. The
battery to which we were both posted was composed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
category C1 men,&mdash;flat-footed unfortunates, unfit to
fight on medical grounds, not even strong enough to
groom horses properly.</p>

<p>A futile existence in paths of unintelligence and
unendeavour worshipping perforce at the altar of
destruction, creating nothing, a slave to dishonesty and
jobbery,&mdash;a waste of life that made one mad with rage
in that everything beautiful in the world was snapped
in half and flung away because the social fabric which
we ourselves had made through the centuries, had at
last become rotten to the core and broken into flaming
slaughter, and was being fanned by yellow press hypocrisy.
Every ideal cried out against it. The sins of the fathers
upon the wilfully blind children. The Kaiser was only
the most pitch-covered torch chosen by Nemesis to set
the bonfire of civilisation ablaze. But for one branch
in the family tree he would have been England’s monarch,
and then&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>There have been moments when I have regretted not
having sailed to New York in August, 1914,&mdash;bitter
moments when all the dishonesty has beaten upon one’s
brain, and one has envied the pluck of the honest conscientious
objector who has stood out against the ridicule
of the civilised world.</p>

<p>The only thought that kept me going was “suppose
the Huns had landed in England and I had not been
fighting?” It was unanswerable,&mdash;as I thought then.</p>

<p>Now I wish that the Hun had landed in England in
force and laid waste the East coast, as he has devastated
Belgium and the north of France. There would have
been English refugees with perambulators and babies,
profiteers crying “Kamerad!” politicians fleeing the
House. There would have been some hope of England’s
understanding. But she doesn’t even now. There were
in 1918, before the armistice, men&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">MEN!</span>&mdash;who, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
their valets failed to put their cuff links in their shirts one
morning, were sarcastic to their war-working wives, and
talked of the sacrifices they had made for their country.</p>

<p>How <em>dared</em> they have valets, while we were lousy and
unshaved, with rotting corpses round our gun wheels?
How <em>dared</em> they have wives, while we “unmarried and
without ties” were either driven in our weakness to
licensed women, or clung to our chastity because of the
one woman with us every hour in our hearts, whom we
meant to marry if ever we came whole out of that hell?</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Christmas came. They would not let me go down
to that little house among the pines and beeches, which
has ever been “home” to me. But the day was spent
quietly in London with my best pal. Seven days later
I was on my way to Ireland as one of the advance representatives
of the Division. The destination of my
brigade was Limerick, that place of pigs, and smells,
and pretty girls and schoolboy rebels, who chalked on
every barrack wall, “Long live the Kaiser! Down with
the King!” Have you ever been driven to the depths
of despair, seen your work go to pieces before your eyes,
and spent the dreadful days in dishonest idleness on the
barrack square, hating it all the while, but unable to
move hand or foot to get out of the mental morass?
That is what grew up in Limerick. Even now my mind
shivers in agony at the thought of it.</p>

<p>Reinforcements had poured into the battery of cripples,
and the order came that from it a fighting battery should
be formed. As senior subaltern, who had been promised
a captaincy, I was given charge of them. The only other
officer with me was the loyalest pal a man ever had.
He had been promoted on the field for gallantry, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
served ten years in the ranks as trumpeter, gunner,
corporal and sergeant. Needless to say, he knew the
game backwards, and was the possessor of amazing
energy and efficiency. He really ought to have had the
command, for my gunnery was almost nil, but I had one
pip more than he, and so the system put him under my
orders. So we paraded the first men, and told them off
into sections and were given a horse or two, gradually
building up a battery as more reinforcements arrived.</p>

<p>How we worked! The enthusiasm of a first command!
For a fortnight we never left the barracks,&mdash;drilling,
marching, clothing and feeding the fighting unit of which
we hoped such great things. All our hearts and souls
were in it, and the men themselves were keen and worked
cheerily and well. One shook off depressing philosophies
and got down to the solid reality of two hundred men.
The early enthusiasm returned, and Pip Don&mdash;as my
pal was called&mdash;and I were out for glory and killing Huns.</p>

<p>The Colonel looked us over and was pleased. Life
wasn’t too bad, after all.</p>

<p>And then the blight set in. An officer was posted to
the command of the little fighting unit.</p>

<p>In a week all the fight had gone out of it. In another
week Pip Don and I declared ourselves beaten. All our
interest was killed. The sergeant-major, for whom I
have a lasting respect, was like Bruce’s spider. Every
time he fell, he at once started reclimbing. He alone was
responsible for whatever discipline remained. The captaincy
which I had been promised on certain conditions
was filled by some one else the very day I carried out
the conditions. It didn’t matter. Everything was so
hopeless that the only thing left was to get out,&mdash;and
that was the one thing we couldn’t do, because we were
more or less under orders for France. It reached such
a pitch that even the thought of being flung away in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
open was welcome. At least it would end it all. There
was no secret about it. The Colonel knew. Didn’t he
come to my room one night, and say, “Look here, Gibbs,
what is the matter with your battery?” And didn’t
we have another try, and another?</p>

<p>So for a time Pip Don and I smoked cigarettes on the
barrack square, strolling listlessly from parade to parade,
cursing the fate that should have brought us to such
dishonour. We went to every dance in Limerick,
organised concerts, patronised the theatre and filled our
lives as much as we could with outside interests until
such time as we should go to France. And then.&mdash;It
would be different when shells began to burst!</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>In the ranks I first discovered that it was a struggle
to keep one’s soul alive. That struggle had proved
far more difficult as an officer in the later days of Salonica.
The bitterness of Limerick, together with the reason, as
I saw it, of the wholesale slaughter, made one’s whole
firmament tremble. Rough hands seemed to tear down
one’s ideals and fling then in the mud. One’s picture of
God and religion faded under the red light of war. One’s
brain flickered in the turmoil, seeking something to cling
to. What was there? Truth? There was none.
Duty? It was a farce. Honour? It was dead. There
was only one thing left, one thing which might give them
all back again,&mdash;Love.</p>

<p>If there was not that in one’s heart to keep fragrant,
to cherish, to run to for help, to look forward to as the
sunshine at the end of a long and awful tunnel, then one’s
soul would have perished and a bullet been a merciful
thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>I was all unconscious that it had been my salvation
in the ranks, in Salonica. Now, on the eve of going
out to the Western Front I recognized it for the first time
to the full. The effect of it was odd,&mdash;a passionate
longing to tear off one’s khaki and leave all this uncleanness,
and at the same time the certain knowledge that
one must go on to the very end, otherwise one would
lose it. If I had been offered a war job in New York,
how could I have taken it, unwounded, the game unfinished,
much as New York called me? So its third
effect was a fierce impatience to get to France, making at
least one more battery to help to end the war.</p>

<p>The days dragged by, the longer from the new knowledge
within me. From time to time the Sinn Fein
gave signs of renewed activity, and either we were all
confined to barracks in consequence, presumably to
avoid street fighting, or else we hooked into the guns
and did route marches through and round about the
town. From time to time arrests were made, but no
open conflict recurred. Apart from our own presence
there was no sign of war in Ireland. Food of all kinds
was plentiful and cheap, restrictions nil. The streets
were well lit at night. Gaiety was the keynote. No
aeroplanes dropped bombs on that brilliant target. The
Hun and pro-Hun had spent too much money there.</p>

<p>Finally our training was considered complete. The
Colonel had laboured personally with all the subalterns,
and we had benefited by his caustic method of imparting
knowledge. And so once more we sat stiffly to
attention while Generals rode round us, metaphorically
poking our ribs to see if we were fat enough for the
slaughter. Apparently we were, for the fighting units
said good-bye to their parent batteries&mdash;how gladly!&mdash;and
shipped across to England to do our firing
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>The camp was at Heytesbury, on the other side of
the vast plain which I had learnt so well as a trooper.
We were a curious medley, several brigades being represented,
each battery a little distrustful of the next, a
little inclined to turn up its nose. Instead of being
“AC,” “Beer,” “C” and “Don,” as before, we were
given consecutive numbers, well into the hundreds, and
after a week or so of dislocation were formed into
brigades, and each put under the command of a Colonel.
Then the stiffness wore off in friendly competition of
trying to pick the best horses from the remounts. Our
men challenged each other to football, sergeant-majors
exchanged notes. Subalterns swapped lies about the
war and Battery Commanders stood each other drinks
in the mess. Within a fortnight we were all certain we’d
got the best Colonel in England, and congratulated ourselves
accordingly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pip Don and I were still outcasts in our
own battery, up against a policy of continual distrust,
suspicion, and scarcely veiled antagonism. It was at
the beginning of April, 1917, that we first got to Heytesbury,
and snow was thick upon the ground. Every day
we had the guns out behind the stables and jumped the
men about at quick, short series, getting them smart
and handy, keeping their interest and keeping them
warm. When the snow disappeared we took the battery
out mounted, taking turns in bringing it into action,
shooting over the sights on moving targets&mdash;other
batteries at work in the distance&mdash;or laying out lines
for indirect targets. We took the staff out on cross-country
rides, scouring the country for miles, and chasing
hares&mdash;it shook them down into the saddle&mdash;carrying out
little signalling schemes. In short, we had a final polish
up of all the knowledge we had so eagerly begun to teach
them when he and I had been in sole command. I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
think either of us can remember any single occasion on
which the commanding officer took a parade.</p>

<p>Embarkation leave was in full swing, four days for
all ranks, and the brigade next to us was ordered to
shoot. Two range officers were appointed from our
brigade. I was one. It was good fun and extremely
useful. We took a party of signallers and all the rations
we could lay hands on, and occupied an old red farmhouse
tucked away in a fold of the plain, in the middle
of all the targets. An old man and his wife lived there,
a quaint old couple, toothless and irritable, well versed
in the ways of the army and expert in putting in claims
for fictitious damages. Our job was to observe and
register each round from splinter proofs, send in a signed
report of each series, stop the firing by signalling if any
stray shepherd or wanderer were seen on the range,
and to see that the targets for the following day’s shoot
had not been blown down or in any other way rendered
useless. It was a four-day affair, firing ending daily
between three and four p.m. This left us ample time
to canter to all the battery positions and work out ranges,
angle of sight and compass bearings for every target,&mdash;information
which would have been invaluable when
our turn to fire arrived. Unfortunately, however,
several slight alterations were intentionally made, and
all our labour was wasted. Still, it was a good four
days of bracing weather, with little clouds scudding across
a blue sky, never quite certain whether in ten minutes’
time the whole world would be blotted out in a blizzard.
The turf was springy, miles upon endless miles, and we
had some most wonderful gallops and practised revolver
shooting on hares and rooks, going back to a huge tea
and a blazing wood fire in the old, draughty farmhouse.</p>

<p>The practice over, we packed up and marched back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
to our respective batteries. Events of a most cataclysmic
nature piled themselves one upon the other,&mdash;friction
between the commanding officer and myself,
orders to fire on a certain day, orders to proceed overseas
on a certain later day, and my dismissal from the
battery, owing to the aforesaid friction, on the opening
day of the firing. Pip Don was furious, the commanding
officer wasn’t, and I “pursued a policy of masterly
inactivity.” The outcome of the firing was not without
humour, and certainly altered the whole future career
of at least two of us. The Captain and the third subaltern
left the battery and became “details.” The commanding
officer became second in command under a new
Major, who dropped out of the blue, and I was posted
back to the battery, together with a new third subaltern,
who had just recovered from wounds.</p>

<p>The business of getting ready was speeded up. The
Ordnance Department, hitherto of miserly reluctance,
gave us lavishly of their best. Gas masks were dished
out, and every man marched into a gas chamber,&mdash;there
either to get gassed or come out with the assurance that
the mask had no defects! Final issues of clothing and
equipment kept the Q.M.S. sweating from dawn to dusk,
and the Major signed countless pay books, indents and
documents generally.</p>

<p>Thus we were ready and eager to go and strafe the Hun
in the merry month of May, 1917.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>The personnel of the battery was odd but extremely
interesting. Pip Don and myself knew every man,
bombardier, corporal and sergeant, what he had done,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
tried to do, or could do. In a word we knew the battery
inside out and exactly what it was worth. Not a man
of them had ever been on active service, but we felt
quite confident that the test of shell fire would not find
them wanting. The great majority of them were Scots,
and they were all as hard as nails.</p>

<p>The third subaltern was an unknown quantity, but
all of us had been out. The Captain hadn’t.</p>

<p>The Major had been in every battle in France since
1914, but he didn’t know us or the battery, and if we
felt supremely confident in him, it was, to say the least
of it, impossible for him to return the compliment. He
himself will tell you that he didn’t win the confidence of
the battery until after a bold and rapidly-decided move
in full light of day, which put us on the flank of a perfectly
hellish bombardment. That may be true of some
of the men, but as far as Pip Don and myself went, we
had adopted him after the first five minutes, and never
swerved,&mdash;having, incidentally, some wonderful arguments
about him in the sleeping quarters at Heytesbury
with the subalterns of other batteries.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how the man at the head of a little
show like that remains steadily in the lime-light. Everything
he does, says or looks is noted, commented on and
placed to either his credit or debit until the men have
finally decided that he’s all right or&mdash;not. If they come
to the first decision, then the Major’s life is not more of
a burden to him than Divisional and Corps Staffs and
the Hun can make it. The battery will do anything he
asks of it, at any hour of day or night, and will go on
shooting till the last man is knocked out. If, on the
other hand, they decide that he is not all right, God
help him. He gives orders. They are not carried out.
Why? An infinite variety of super-excellent excuses.
It is a sort of passive resistance, and he has got to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
mighty clever man to unearth the root of it and kill it
before it kills him.</p>

<p>We went from Southampton to Havre&mdash;it looked
exactly the same as when I’d landed there three years
previously&mdash;and from Havre by train to Merville. There
a guide met us in the chilly dawn and we marched up to
Estaires, the guide halting us at a mud patch looking
like the abomination of desolation, which he said was our
wagon line. It was only about seven miles from the
place where I’d been in the cavalry, and just as muddy,
but somehow I was glad to be back. None of those
side shows at the other end of the map had meant anything.
France was obviously where the issue would
ultimately be decided, and, apart from the Dardanelles,
where the only real fighting was, or ever had been. Let
us, therefore, get on with the war with all speed. Every
year had brought talk of peace before Christmas, soon
dwindling into columns about preparations for another
winter campaign. Even our own men just landed
discussed the chances of being back in Scotland for the
New Year!</p>

<p>We were an Army brigade,&mdash;one of a series of illegitimate
children working under Corps orders and lent
to Divisions who didn’t evince any friendliness when
it came to leave allotments, or withdrawn from our
Divisional area to be hurried to some other part of the
line and flung in in heaps to stiffen the barrage in some
big show. Nobody loved us. Divisions saved their
own people at our expense,&mdash;it was always an Army
brigade which hooked in at zero hour and advanced at
zero + 15, until after the Cambrai show. Ordnance
wanted to know who the hell we were and why our
indents had a Divisional signature and not a Corps one,
or why they hadn’t both, or neither; A.S.C. explained
with a straight face how we <em>always</em> got the best fresh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
meat ration; Corps couldn’t be bothered with us, until
there was a show brewing; Army were polite but incredulous.</p>

<p>The immortal Pyecroft recommends the purchase
of a ham as a sure means of seeing life. As an alternative
I suggest joining an Army brigade.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>In the old days of trench warfare the Armentières
front was known as the peace sector. The town itself,
not more than three thousand yards from the Hun,
was full of happy money-grubbing civilians who served
you an excellent dinner and an equally excellent bottle
of wine, or, if it was clothes you sought, directed you to
Burberry’s, almost as well installed as in the Haymarket.
Divisional infantry used it as a rest billet. Many cook’s
carts ambled peacefully along the cobbled streets laden
with eggs, vegetables and drinks for officers’ messes.
Now and then a rifle was fired in the front line resulting,
almost, in a Court of Enquiry. Three shells in three
days was considered a good average, a trench mortar
a gross impertinence.</p>

<p>Such was the delightful picture drawn for us by
veterans who heard we were going there.</p>

<p>The first step was the attaching of so many officers
and N.C.O.’s to a Divisional battery in the line for
“instruction.” The Captain and Pip Don went up
first and had a merry week. The Major and I went
up next and heard the tale of their exploits. The battery
to which we were attached, in command of a shell-shocked
Major, was in a row of houses, in front of a
smashed church on the fringe of the town, and I learnt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
to take cover or stand still at the blast of a whistle which
meant aeroplanes; saw a fighting map for the first time;
an S.O.S. board in a gun pit and the explanation of retaliation
targets; read the Divisional Defence Scheme
through all its countless pages and remained in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo</i>;
went round the front-line trench and learned that a
liaison officer didn’t take his pyjamas on raid nights;
learned also that a trench mortar bombardment was a
messy, unpleasant business; climbed rung by rung
up a dark and sooty chimney, or was hauled up in a coffin-like
box, to a wooden deck fitted with seats and director
heads and telescopes and gazed down for the first time
on No Man’s Land and the Hun trench system and as
far as the eye could reach in his back areas, learning
somewhat of the difficulties of flank observation. Every
day of that week added depths to the conviction of my
exceeding ignorance. Serbia had been nothing like this.
It was elementary, child’s play. The Major too uttered
strange words like calibration, meteor corrections, charge
corrections. A memory of Salonica came back to me of
a huge marquee in which we had all sat and listened to
a gilded staff officer who had drawn diagrams on a blackboard
and juggled with just such expressions while we
tried hard not to go to sleep in the heat; and afterwards
the Battery Commanders had argued it and decided almost
unanimously that it was “all right for schools of gunnery
but not a damn bit o’ use in the field.” To the Major,
however, these things seemed as ordinary as whisky
and pickles.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that the sooner I began
to learn something the better. It wasn’t easy because
young Pip Don had the hang of it all, so he and the Major
checked each other’s figures while I looked on, vainly
endeavouring to follow. There was never any question
as to which of us ought to have had the second pip. How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>ever
it worked itself out all right because, owing to the
Major, he got his captaincy before I did, which was
the best possible thing that could have happened, for I
then became the Major’s right-hand man and felt the
responsibility of it.</p>

<p>At the end of our week of instruction the brigade
went into action, two batteries going to the right group,
two to the left. The group consisted of the Divisional
batteries, trench mortar batteries, the 60-pounders and
heavy guns attached like ourselves. We were on the
left, the position being just in front of a 4.5 howitzer battery
and near the Lunatic Asylum.</p>

<p>It was an old one, four gun pits built up under a row
of huge elms, two being in a row of houses. The men
slept in bunks in the pits and houses; for a mess we
cleaned out a room in the château at the corner which
had been sadly knocked about, and slept in the houses
near the guns. The château garden was full of lilac
and roses, the beds all overgrown with weeds and the
grass a jungle, but still very beautiful. Our zone had
been allotted and our own private chimney O.P.&mdash;the
name of which I have forgotten&mdash;and we had a copy
of that marvellous defence scheme.</p>

<p>Then for a little we found ourselves in the routine
of trench warfare,&mdash;tours of duty at the O.P. on alternate
days and keeping a detailed log book in its swaying
deck, taking our turn weekly to supply a liaison officer
with the infantry who went up at dark, dined in their
excellent mess, slept all night in the signalling officer’s
bunk, and returned for a shave and a wash after breakfast
next morning; firing retaliation salvos at the call
of either the O.P. or the infantry; getting up rations and
ammunition and letters at a regular hour every night;
sending off the countless “returns” which are the curse
of soldiering; and quietly feeling our feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>The O.P. was in an eastern suburb called Houplines,
some twenty minutes’ walk along the tram lines. At
dawn one had reached it with two signallers and was
looking out from the upper deck upon an apparently
peaceful countryside of green fields splashed yellow with
mustard patches, dotted with sleepy cottages, from whose
chimneys smoke never issued, woods and spinneys in
all the glory of their spring budding running up on to the
ridge, the Aubers ridge. The trenches were an intricate
series of gashes hidden by Nature with poppies and
weeds. Then came a grim brown space unmarked
by any trench, tangled with barbed wire, and then began
the repetition of it all except for the ridge at our own
trenches. The early hours were chilly and misty and
one entered in the log book, “6 a.m. Visibility nil.”</p>

<p>But with the sun the mist rolled up like a blind at
one’s window and the larks rocketed into the clear blue
as though those trenches were indeed deserted. Away
on the left was a town, rising from the curling river in
terraces of battered ruins, an inexpressible desolation,
silent, empty, dead. Terrible to see that gaping skeleton
of a town in the flowering countryside. Far in the
distance, peeping above the ridge and visible only through
glasses, was a faint pencil against the sky&mdash;the great factory
chimney outside Lille.</p>

<p>Peace seemed the keynote of it all in the soft perfumed
heat of that early summer. Yet eyes looked
steadily out from every chimney and other eyes from
the opposite ridge; and with just a word down the
wire trenches went in smoking heaps, houses fell like
packs of cards touched by a child’s finger, noise beat
upon the brain and Death was the master whom we
worshipped, upon whose altar we made bloody sacrifice.</p>

<p>We hadn’t been there much more than a week when
we had our first hint of the hourly reality of it. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
third subaltern, who hadn’t properly recovered from the
effect of his wound, was on his way up to the O.P. one
morning and had a misadventure with a shell. He heard
it coming, a big one, and sought refuge in the nearest
house. The shell unfortunately selected the same house.</p>

<p>When the dust had subsided and the ruins had assumed
their final shape the subaltern emerged, unwounded,
but unlike his former self.&mdash;The doctor diagnosed
shell shock and the work went on without him.</p>

<p>It seemed as though that were the turning point in
the career of the peace sector.</p>

<p>The Hun began a leisurely but persistent destruction
of chimneys with five-nines. One heard the gun in the
distance, not much more than the popping of a champagne
cork at the other end of the Carlton Grill. Some
seconds later you thought you heard the inner circle
train come in at Baker Street. Dust choked you, the
chimney rocked in the frightful rush of wind, followed
by a soul-shaking explosion,&mdash;and you looked through
the black aperture of the chimney to see a pillar of smoke
and falling earth spattering down in the sunshine. And
from the lower deck immediately beneath you came the
voice of the signaller, “They ought to give us sailor suits
up ’ere, sir!”</p>

<p>And passing a finger round the inside of your sticky
collar which seemed suddenly a little tight, you sat down
firmly again and said, “Yes.&mdash;Is the steward about?”</p>

<p>Within sixty seconds another champagne cork popped.
Curse the Carlton Grill!</p>

<p>In addition to the delights of the O.P. the Hun “found”
the battery. It happened during the week that the
Captain came up to have a look round and in the middle
of the night. I was sleeping blissfully at liaison and
returned next morning to find a most unpleasant smell
of cordite hanging about, several houses lying on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
pavement, including the one Pip Don and I shared, great
branches all over the road and one gun pit looking somewhat
bent. It appeared that Pip Don had spent the
remainder of the night rounding up gunners in his pyjamas.
No one was hurt. The Captain returned to the wagon
line during the course of the morning.</p>

<p>Having found us, the Hun put in a few hundred rounds
whenever he felt bored,&mdash;during the 9 a.m. parade, at
lunch time, before tea and at the crack of dawn. The
old red garden wall began to look like a Gruyère cheese,
the road was all pockmarked, the gun pits caught fire
and had to be put out, the houses began to fall even
when there was no shelling and it became a very unhealthy
corner. Through it all the Major was a tower
of strength. So long as he was there the shelling didn’t
seem to matter, but if he were absent one didn’t <em>quite</em>
know whether to give the order to clear for the time being
or stick it out. The Hun’s attentions were not by any
means confined to our position. The systematic bombardment
of the town had begun and it became the usual
thing to hear a horrible crackling at night and see the
whole sky red. The Major of one of our batteries was
killed, the senior subaltern badly wounded and several
of their guns knocked out by direct hits. We were lucky.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the Right Group, who had been watching
this without envy from the undisturbed calm of the
countryside, decided to make a daylight raid by way
of counter-attraction and borrowed us for the occasion.
The Major and I went down to reconnoitre a battery position
and found a delightful spot behind a hedge under a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
row of spreading elms. Between the two, camouflage
was unnecessary and, as a cobbled road ran immediately
in front of the hedge, there was no danger of making any
tracks. It was a delightful position with a farmhouse
two hundred yards along the road. The relief of getting
out of the burning city, of not having to dodge shells
at unexpected moments, of knowing that the rations
and ammunition could come up without taking a twenty
to one chance of being scuppered!</p>

<p>The raid was just like any other raid, except that
it happened to be the first barrage we fired, the first
barrage table we worked out, the first time we used
the 106 fuse, and the first time that at the eleventh
hour we were given the task, in which someone else
had failed, of cutting the wire. I had been down with
the Major when he shot the battery in,&mdash;and hadn’t
liked it. In places there was no communication trench
at all and we had to crawl on our bellies over a chaos of
tumbled earth and revetments in full view of any sniper,
and having to make frequent stops because the infernal
signaller would lag behind and turn off. And a few hours
before the show the Major was called upon to go down there
and cut the wire at all costs. Pip Don was signalling
officer. He and every available signaller, stacks of
wire and lamps, spread themselves in a living chain
between the Major and the front-line trench and me at
the battery. Before going the Major asked me if I had
the barrage at my finger tips. I had. Then if he didn’t
get back in time, he said, I could carry out the show
all right? I could,&mdash;and watched him go with a mouth
full of bitter curses against the Battery Commander who
had failed to cut that wire. My brain drew lurid pictures
of stick-bombs, minnies, pineapples, pip-squeaks and
five-nines being the reason why the Major wouldn’t
get back “in time.” And I sat down by the telephonist,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
praying for the call that would indicate at least his safe
arrival in the front-line trench.</p>

<p>Beside every gun lay a pile of 106 fuses ready. Orders
were to go on firing if every German plane in the entire
Vaterland came over.&mdash;Still they weren’t through on
the ’phone!</p>

<p>I went along from gun to gun, making sure that everything
was all right and insisting on the necessity of the
most careful laying, stopping from time to time to yell
to the telephonist “Through yet?” and getting a “No,
sir” every time that almost made me hear those cursed
minnies dropping on the Major. At last he called up.
The tension was over. We had to add a little for <ins class="corr" id="tn-144" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the 106 fuze'">
the 106 fuse</ins> but each gun was registered on the wire within
four rounds. The Major was a marvel at that. Then the
shoot began.</p>

<p>Aeroplanes came winging over, regardless of our
Archies. But we, regardless of the aeroplanes, were
doing “battery fire 3 secs.” as steadily as if we were
on Salisbury Plain, getting from time to time the order,
“Five minutes more right.” We had three hundred rounds
to do the job with and only about three per gun were left
when the order “Stop” arrived. I stopped and hung
on to the ’phone. The Major’s voice, coming as though
from a million miles away, said, “Napoo wire. How
many more rounds?”</p>

<p>“Three per gun, sir.”</p>

<p>“Right.&mdash;All guns five degrees more right for
the onlooker, add two hundred, three rounds gun fire.”</p>

<p>I made it so, received the order to stand down, put
the fitter and the limber gunners on to sponging out,&mdash;and
tried to convince myself that all the noise down
in front was miles away from the Major and Pip Don.&mdash;It
seemed years before they strolled in, a little muddy
but as happy as lambs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>It occurred to me then that I knew something at
least of what our women endured at home every day
and all day,&mdash;just one long suspense, without even the
compensation of <em>doing</em> anything.</p>

<p>The raid came off an hour or so later like clockwork,
without incident. Not a round came back at us and we
stood down eventually with the feeling of having put in
a good day’s work.</p>

<p>We were a very happy family in those days. The
awful discouragement of Limerick had lifted. Bombardments
and discomforts were subjects for humour,
work became a joy, “crime” in the gun line disappeared
and when the time arrived for sending the gunners
down to the wagon line for a spell there wasn’t one who
didn’t ask if he might be allowed to stay on. It was due
entirely to the Major. For myself I can never be thankful
enough for having served under him. He came at a time
when one didn’t care a damn whether one were court-martialled
and publicly disgraced. One was “through”
with the Army and cared not a curse for discipline or
appearances. With his arrival all that was swept away
without a word being said. Unconsciously he set a
standard to which one did one’s utmost to live, and that
from the very moment of his arrival. One found that
there was honour in the world and loyalty, that duty
was not a farce. In some extraordinary way he embodied
them all, forcing upon one the desire for greater
self-respect; and the only method of acquiring it was
effort, physical and mental, in order to get somewhere
near his high standard. I gave him the best that was in
me. When he left the brigade, broken in health by the
ceaseless call upon his own effort, he wrote me a letter.
Of all that I shall take back with me to civil life from
the Army that letter is what I value most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>We had all cherished the hope that we had seen the
last of the town; that Right Group, commanded by our
own colonel, would keep us in our present position.</p>

<p>There was a distinct drop in the mental temperature
when, the raid over, we received the order to report
back to Left Group. But we still clung to the hope that
we might be allowed to choose a different gun position.
That avenue of trees was far too accurately pin-pointed
by the Hun. Given, indeed, that there were many other
places from which one could bring just as accurate and
concentrated fire to bear on our part of the zone, it was
criminal folly to order us back to the avenue. That,
however, was the order. It needed a big effort to find
any humour in it.</p>

<p>We hooked in and pulled out of that peaceful raid
position with a sigh of regret and bumped our way back
over the cobbles through the burning town, keeping
a discreet distance between vehicles. The two houses
which had been the emplacements of the left section
were unrecognizable as gun pits, so we used the other
four pits and put the left section forward in front of the
Asylum under camouflage. Not less than ten balloons
looked straight down on the gun muzzles. The detachment
lived in a cellar under the Asylum baths.</p>

<p>Then Pip Don got his captaincy and went to another
battery, to the safety and delights of the wagon line.
One missed him horribly. We got a new subaltern who
had never been out before but who was as stout as a lion.
Within a few days our Captain was sent back ill and I
followed Pip Don to the wagon lines as Captain in my
own battery, a most amazing stroke of luck. We fore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>gathered
in a restaurant at Estaires and held a celebration
dinner together, swearing that between us we
would show the finest teams and the best harness in
France, discussing the roads we meant to build through
the mud, the improvements we were instantly going to
start in the horse standings.</p>

<p>Great dreams that lasted just three days! Then
his Major went on leave and he returned to command
the battery, within five hundred yards of ours. The
following day I was hurriedly sent for to find the whole
world reeking with gas, mustard gas. Everybody had
streaming eyes and noses. Within three minutes I was
as bad as the rest.</p>

<p>How anybody got through the next days I don’t
know. Four days and nights it lasted, one curious
hissing rain of shells which didn’t burst with a crash
but just uttered a little pop, upon which the ground
became spattered with yellow liquid and a greyish fog
spread round about. Five-nines, seventeen-inch, high
explosive and incendiary shells were mixed in with the
gas. Communications went wholesale. Fires roared in
every quarter of the town. Hell was let loose and always
the gas choked and blinded. Hundreds of civilians died
of it although they had previously been warned repeatedly
to clear out. The conviction was so strong that Armentières
was the peace sector that the warnings were disregarded.</p>

<p>The howitzer battery behind us had been reinforced
with ninety men and two officers the day before the show
started. After that first night one officer was left.
He had been up a chimney O.P. all night. The rest went
away again in ambulance wagons. It was a holocaust,
a shambles. A colossal attack was anticipated, and as all
communications had gone the signallers were out in gas
masks all over the town, endeavouring to repair lines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
broken in a hundred places, and a constant look-out was
kept for S.O.S. signals from the infantry.</p>

<p>Except when shooting all our men were kept underground
in gas masks, beating the gas away with “flappers.”
The shelling was so ceaseless and violent round
about the position that when men were sent from one section
to another with messages they went in couples, their
departure being telephoned to the section. If their
arrival was not reported within ten minutes a search
party was sent to find them. To put one’s head above
ground at any moment of day or night was to take one’s
life in one’s hands. Ammunition went up, and gun
pits caught fire and the rain of shells never ceased. To get
to the O.P. one had to fling oneself flat in a ditch countless
times, always with an ear stretched for the next shell.
From minute to minute it was a toss-up, and blackened
corpses and screaming, mangled wounded left a bloody
trail in the stinking, cobbled streets. The peace
sector!</p>

<p>Was it just a Boche measure to prevent us from
using the town as billets any more? Or was it a retaliation
for the taking of the Messines Ridge which we had
watched from our chimney not many weeks before,
watched in awe and wonder, thanking God we were not
taking part in that carnage? The unhealthy life and
the unceasing strain told even on the Major. We were
forced to live by the light of candles in a filthy cellar
beneath the château, snatching uneasy periods of rest
when one lay on a bunk with goggles on one’s smarting
eyes, breathing with labour, listening to the heavy thud
of shells up above and the wheezing and sneezing of the
unfortunate signallers, getting up and going about
one’s work in a sort of stupor, dodging shells rather
by instinct than reason and tying up wounded with a
dull sickness at the pit of one’s stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>But through it all one’s thoughts of home intertwined
with the reek of death like honeysuckle with deadly
nightshade, as though one’s body were imprisoned in that
foul underground hole while one’s mind soared away and
refused to come back. It was all a strange dream, a
clammy nightmare. Letters came, filled with all the
delicious everyday doings of another world, filling one’s
brain with a scent of verbena and briar rose, like the cool
touch of a woman’s hands on the forehead of a man in
delirium.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>On the morning of the fifth day the gas shelling ceased
and the big stuff became spasmodic,&mdash;concentrations of
twenty minutes’ duration.</p>

<p>One emerged into the sun, sniffing carefully. The
place was even more unrecognizable than one had imagined
possible. The château still stood but many direct
hits had filled the garden with blocks of stone. The
Asylum was a mass of ruins, the grounds pitted with shell
holes. The town itself was no longer a place to dine and
shop. A few draggled inhabitants slunk timidly about
like rats, probing the debris of what had once been their
homes. The cobbled streets were great pits where seventeen-inch
shells had landed, half filled again with the
houses which had toppled over on either side. The
hotels, church and shops in the big square were gutted
by fire, great beams and house fronts blocking the roadway.
Cellars were blown in and every house yawned open
to the sky. In place of the infantry units and transports
clattering about the streets was a desolate silent emptiness
punctuated by further bombardments and the
echoing crash of falling walls. And, over all, that sickly
smell of mustard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>It was then that the Left Group Commander had
a brain wave and ordered a trial barrage on the river
Lys in front of Frelinghein. It was about as mad a thing
as making rude noises at a wounded rhinoceros, given that
every time a battery fired the Boche opened a concentration.</p>

<p>Pip Don had had three seventeen-inch in the middle
of his position. Nothing much was found of one gun
and its detachment except a head and a boot containing
a human foot.</p>

<p>The Group Commander had given the order, however,
and there was nothing to do but to get on with
it.&mdash;</p>

<p>The barrage was duly worked out. It was to last
eighteen minutes with a certain number of lifts and
switches. The Group Commander was going to observe it
from one of the chimneys.</p>

<p>My job was to look after the left section in the open
in front of the Asylum. Ten minutes before zero I dived
into the cellar under the baths breathless, having dodged
three five-nines. There I collected the men and gathered
them under cover of the doorway. There we waited
for a minute to see where the next would burst. It hit
a building twenty-five yards away.</p>

<p>“Now!” said I, “double!” and we ran, jumping
shell holes and flinging ourselves flat for one more five-nine.
The guns were reached all right, the camouflage
pulled back and everything made ready for action. Five
Hun balloons gazed down at us straight in front, and three
of his aeroplanes came and circled low over our heads,
and about every minute the deafening crash of that most
demoralizing five-nine burst just behind us. I lay
down on the grass between the two guns and gazed
steadfastly at my wrist watch.</p>

<p>“Stand by!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>The hands of the Numbers 3 stole out to the handles
of the firing lever.</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>The whole of Armentières seemed to fire at once.
The Group Commander up in his chimney ought to
have been rather pleased. Four rounds per gun per
minute was the rate. Then at zero plus one I heard
that distant pop of Hun artillery and with the usual
noise the ground heaved skyward between the two
guns just in front. It wasn’t more than twelve and a
half yards away. The temptation to run made me itch
all over.</p>

<p>Pop! it went again. My forehead sank on to my
wrist watch.</p>

<p>A good bracket, twelve and a half yards behind, and
again lumps of earth spattered on to my back. The itch
became a disease. The next round, according to all
the laws of gunnery, ought to fall between my collar and
my waist.&mdash;</p>

<p>I gave the order to lift, straining my ears.</p>

<p>There came no pop. I held my breath so that I might
hear better,&mdash;and only heard the thumping of my heart.
We lifted again and again.&mdash;</p>

<p>I kept them firing for three full seconds after the
allotted time before I gave the order to cease fire. The
eighteen minutes&mdash;lifetimes&mdash;were over and that third
pop didn’t come till we had stopped. Then having
covered the guns we ran helter-skelter, each man finding
his own way to the cellar through the most juicy bombardment
we’d heard for quite twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Every man answered to his name in the cellar darkness
and there was much laughter and tobacco smoke while
we got back our breath.</p>

<p>Half an hour later their bombardment ceased. The
sergeant and I went back to have a look at the guns.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Number 5 was all right. Number 6, however, had had
a direct hit, one wheel had burnt away and she lay on
her side, looking very tired.</p>

<p>I don’t know how many other guns had been knocked
out in the batteries taking part, but, over and above
the value of the ammunition, that trial barrage cost at
least one eighteen-pounder! And but for a bit of luck
would have cost the lives of the detachment.</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>The Major decided to move the battery and gained
the reluctant consent of the Group Commander who
refused to believe that there had been any shelling
there till he saw the gun lying burnt and smashed and
the pits burnt and battered. The Hun seemed to take
a permanent dislike to the Asylum and its neighbourhood.
It may have been coincidence but any time a man showed
there a rain of shells chivvied him away. It took the fitter
and the detachment about seven trips before they got a new
wheel on, and at any hour of day or night you could bet
on at least a handful of four-twos. The gas was intermittent.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the morning after a worrying night
when I had gone out twice to extinguish gun pits reported
on fire, the Major announced that he was going to get the
gun out and disappeared out of the cellar into the shell-lit
darkness.</p>

<p>Two hours later he called up from Group Headquarters
and told me to get the other out and take her to Archie
Square, a square near the station, so-called because a
couple of anti-aircraft guns had used it as an emplacement
in the peace days. With one detachment on each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
drag rope we ran the gauntlet in full daylight of a four-two
bombardment, rushing shell holes and what had
once been flower beds, keeping at a steady trot, the sweat
pouring off us.</p>

<p>The Major met us in Archie Square and we went
back to our cellar for breakfast together.</p>

<p>Of the alternative positions one section was in Chapelle
d’Armentières. We hoped great things of it. It looked
all right, pits being built in the back yards of a row of
small houses, with plenty of trees for cover and lots of
fruit for the men,&mdash;raspberries, plums, and red currants.
Furthermore the shell holes were all old. The only crab
about it was getting there. Between us and it were two
much-shelled spots called Sandbag Corner and Snow
Corner. Transports used to canter past them at night
and the Hun had an offensive habit of dropping barrages
on both of them any time after dark. But there was a
place called Crown Prince House at Sandbag Corner
and I fancy he used this as a datum point. While the
left section went straight on to the Chapelle the other
two turned to the right at Snow Corner and were to
occupy some houses just along the road and a garden
next to them under camouflage.</p>

<p>I shall not forget the night of that move in a hurry.
In the afternoon the Major returned to the battery at
tea time. There was no shelling save our own anti-aircraft,
and perfect sunshine.</p>

<p>“The teams are due at ten o’clock,” said he. “The
Hun will start shelling precisely at that time. We will
therefore move <em>now</em>. Let us function.” We functioned!</p>

<p>The battery was called together and the nature of the
business explained. Each detachment pulled down the
parados in the rear of the gun pits and such part of the
pit itself as was necessary to allow the gun to come out,&mdash;no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
light task because the pits had been built to admit
the gun from the front. As soon as each reported ready
double detachments were told off to the drag ropes and
the gun, camouflaged with branches, was run out and
along the lane and round the corner of the château.
There they were all parked, one by one. Then the
ammunition was brought, piles of it. Then all the
gun stores and kits.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the teams were heard at the other
end of the cobbled street. A moment later shells began
to burst on the position, gun fire. From the cover
afforded by the château and the wall we loaded up
without casualty and hooked in, bits of shell and wall
flying over our heads viciously.</p>

<p>I took charge of the left section in Archie Square.
The vehicles were packed, dixies tied on underneath.
The Major was to follow with the four guns and the
other subaltern at ten minutes’ interval.</p>

<p>Keeping fifty yards between vehicles I set off, walking
in front of the leading gun team. We clattered along the
cobbled streets, rattling and banging. The station was
being bombarded. We had to go over the level crossing
a hundred yards or so in rear of it. I gave the order to
trot. A piece of shell sent up a shower of sparks in front
of the rear gun team. The horses bucked violently
and various dixies fell off, but I kept on until some
distance to a flank under the houses. The dixies were
rescued and re-tied. There was Sandbag Corner to navigate
yet, <em>and</em> Snow Corner. It was horribly dark, impossible
to see shell holes until you were into them, and
all the time shells were bursting in every direction. The
road up to the two Corners ran straight towards the Hun,
directly enfiladed by him. We turned into it at a walk
and were half-way along when a salvo fell round Crown
Prince House just ahead. I halted immediately, won<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>dering
where in heaven’s name the next would fall,
the horses snorting and prancing at my back. For
a couple of minutes there was a ragged burst of gun
fire while we stood with the bits missing us. Then
I gave the order to trot. The horses needed no encouragement.
I could only just keep in front, carrying
maps and a torch and with most of my equipment on.
We carried on past Crown Prince House, past Sandbag
Corner and walked again, blown and tottering, towards
Snow Corner, and only just got past it when a barrage
dropped right on the cross-roads. It was there that the
Major would have to turn to the right with his four guns
presently. Please God it would stop before he came
along.</p>

<p>We weren’t very far behind the support lines now
and the pop-pop-pop, pop-pop-pop of machine guns
was followed by the whistling patter of bullets. I
kept the teams as close under the houses as I dared.
There was every kind of devilment to bring a horse
down, open drains, coils of tangled wire, loose debris.
Eventually we reached the Chapelle and the teams
went off at the trot as soon as the ammunition was
dumped and the kits were off.</p>

<p>Then in the black night we heaved and hauled the
guns into their respective pits and got them on to their
aiming posts and S.O.S. lines.</p>

<p>It was 3 a.m. before I got back to the new headquarters,
a house in an orchard, and found the Major safe and sound.</p>

<p>A couple of days later the Major was ordered to a rest
camp and at a moment’s notice I found myself in command
of the battery. It was one of the biggest moments
of my life. Although I had gone down to take the Captain’s
place my promotion hadn’t actually gone through
and I was still a subaltern, faced with the handling of six
guns at an extremely difficult moment and with the lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
of some fifty men in my hands, to say nothing of the
perpetual responsibility to the infantry in the front line.</p>

<p>It was only when the Major had said good-bye and
I was left that I began to realize just how greatly one
had depended on him. All the internal arrangements
which he had handled so easily that they seemed no
trouble loomed up as insurmountable difficulties&mdash;returns,
ammunition, rations, relieving the personnel&mdash;all
over and above the constant worry of gun detachments
being shelled out, lines being cut, casualties being got
away. It was only then that I realized what a frightful
strain he must have endured during those days of continual
gas and bombardment, the feeling of personal
responsibility towards every single man, the vital necessity
through it all of absolute accuracy of every angle and
range, lest by being flustered or careless one should shoot
one’s own infantry, the nights spent with one ear eternally
on the telephone and the added strain of sleeplessness.&mdash;A
lonely job, Battery Commander.</p>

<p>I realized, too, what little use I had been to him.
Carrying out orders, yes, but not really taking any of the
weight off his shoulders.</p>

<p>The insignificance of self was never so evident as that
first night with my ear to the ’phone, all the night noises
accentuated in the darkness, the increasing machine-gun
fire which might mean an attack, the crashing of shells
which might get my supply wagons on their way back,
the jump when the ’phone buzzed suddenly, making my
heart leap against my ribs, only to put me through to
Group for an order to send over thirty rounds on a minnie
firing in C 16 d o 4.&mdash;It was good to see the blackness
turn to grey and recognize objects once more in the room,
to know that at last the infantry were standing down
and to sink at last into deep sleep as the grey became
rose and the sun awoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Do the men ever realize, I wonder, that the Major
who snaps out orders, who curses so freely, who gives
them extra guards and docks their pay, can be a human
being like themselves whose one idea is <em>their</em> comfort
and safety, that they may strafe the Hun and not get
strafed?</p>

<p>It was my first experience in handling subalterns,
too, and I came to see them from a new point of view.
Hitherto one’s estimation of them had been limited
by their being good fellows or not. The question of
their knowledge or ignorance hadn’t mattered. One
could always give them a hand or do the thing oneself.
Now it was reversed. Their knowledge, working capabilities
and stout-heartedness came first. Their being
good fellows was secondary, but helpful. The most ignorant
will learn more in a week in the line than in ten
weeks in a gunnery school.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>The first few days in the new position were calm.
It gave one time to settle down. We did a lot of shooting
and apart from a spare round or two in our direction
nothing came back in return. The Hun was still plastering
the Asylum and the avenue at all times of day, to
our intense joy. The more he shelled it the more we
chuckled. One felt that the Major had done Fritz in
the eye. So we gathered plums and raspberries in the
warm sun, rejoicing that the horrible smell of mustard
gas was no more. There was a fly in the ointment, of
course. It consisted of several thousand rounds of ammunition
in the Asylum which we were ordered to salvage.
The battery clerk, a corporal of astounding stout-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>ness
who had had countless escapes by an inch already
in the handling of it, and who subsequently became one
of the best sergeants in the battery, undertook to go and
see what could be done. He took with him the fitter,
a lean Scot, who was broken-hearted because he had left
a file there and who wanted to go and scratch about the
ruins to try and recover it. These two disappeared into
the Asylum during a momentary lull. Before they returned
the Hun must have sent in about another fifteen
hundred rounds, all big stuff. They came in hot and
covered with brick dust. The fitter had got his file and
showed it with joy and affection. The corporal had made
a rough count of the rounds and estimated that at least
a couple of hundred had “gone up” or were otherwise
rendered useless.</p>

<p>To my way of thinking it would have been manslaughter
to have sent teams to get the stuff away, so
I decided to let time solve the problem and leave well
alone. Eventually it did solve itself. Many weeks later
another battery occupied the position (Poor devils. It
still reeked of gas) and I had the pleasure of showing
the Battery Commander where the ammunition was and
handing it over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Boche had “found” the left and centre
sections. In addition to that the Group Commander
conceived a passion to experiment with guns in the front-line
trenches, to enfilade the enemy over open sights
at night and generally to put the fear of God into him.
Who more suitable than the Army brigade battery commanded
by that subaltern?</p>

<p>I was sent for and told all about it, and sent to reconnoitre
suitable positions. Seeing that the enemy
had all the observation and a vast preponderance of
artillery I did all in my power to dissuade the Commander.
He had been on active service, however, before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
I was born&mdash;he told me so&mdash;and had forgotten more
things than I should ever know. He had, indeed,
forgotten them.</p>

<p>The long and short of it was that I took a subaltern
with me, and armed with compasses and trench maps,
we studied the whole zone at distances varying from
three to five hundred yards from the enemy front-line
trench. The best place of all happened to be near
Battalion Headquarters. Needless to say, the Colonel
ordered me off.</p>

<p>“You keep your damn things away. There’s quite
enough shelling here without your planting a gun. Come
and have a drink.”</p>

<p>Eventually, however, we got two guns “planted”
with cover for the detachments. It was an absolute
waste of guns. The orders were only to fire if the enemy
came over the top by day and on special targets by night.
The difficulty of rationing them was extreme, it made
control impossible from battery headquarters, because
the lines went half a dozen times a day and left me only
two sections to do all the work with.</p>

<p>The only thing they ever fired at was a very near
balloon one afternoon. Who gave the order to fire
remains a mystery. The sergeant swore the infantry
Colonel gave it.</p>

<p>My own belief is that it was a joy shoot on the sergeant’s
part. He was heartily cursed for his pains, didn’t hit
the balloon, and within twenty-four hours the gun was
knocked out. The area was liberally shelled, to the
discomfort of the infantry, so if the Colonel did give the
order, he had only himself to thank for the result.</p>

<p>The headquarters during this time was an odd round
brick building, like a pagoda in the middle of a narrow
orchard. A high red brick wall surrounded the orchard
which ran down to the road. At the road edge were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
two houses completely annihilated. Plums, greengages,
raspberries and red currants were in abundance. The
signallers and servants were in dug-outs outside the wall.
Curiously enough, this place was not marked on the
map. Nor did the Hun seem to have it on his aeroplane
photographs. In any case, although he shelled round
about, I can only remember one which actually burst
inside the walls.</p>

<p>Up at Chapelle d’Armentières the left section was
almost unrecognizable. Five-nines had thumped it out
of all shape, smashed down the trees, ploughed up the
garden and scattered the houses into the street. The
detachment spent its time day and night in clearing out
into neighbouring ditches and dug-outs, and coming
back again. They shot between whiles, neither of the
guns having been touched, and I don’t think they slept
at all. None of them had shaved for days.</p>

<p>As regards casualties we were extraordinarily lucky.
Since leaving the town not a man had been hit or gassed.
For the transport at night I had reconnoitred a road
which avoided the town entirely and those dangerous
cross-roads, and took them right through the support
line, within a quarter of a mile of the Boche. The road
was unshelled, and only a few machine-gun bullets spat
on it from time to time. So they used it nightly, and
not a horse or driver was touched.</p>

<p>Then the Right Group had another raid and borrowed
us again. The white house and the orchard which we
had used before were unoccupied. I decided to squeeze
up a bit and get all six guns in. The night of the move
was a colossal undertaking. The teams were late, and
the Hun chose to drop a gas barrage round us. More
than that, in the afternoon I had judged my time and
dodged in between two bombardments to visit the left
section. They were absolutely done in, so tired that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
they could hardly keep their eyes open. The others
were little better, having been doing all the shooting for
days. However, I ordered them to vacate the left
section and come along to me at Battery Headquarters
for a rest before the night’s work. They dragged themselves
there, and fell asleep in heaps in the orchard in
the wet. The subaltern and the sergeant came into the
building, drank a cup of tea each and filled the place
with their snores. So I sent for another sergeant and
suggested that he and his men, who had had a brief
rest that day, should go and get the left section guns
out while these people handled his as best they could.
He jumped at it and swore he’d get the guns out, begging
me to keep my teams well to the side of the road. If he
had to canter they were coming out, and he was going
to ride the lead horse himself,&mdash;splendid fellow.</p>

<p>Then I collected the subalterns and detailed them
for the plan of campaign. The left section man said he
was going with his guns. So I detailed the junior to
see the guns into the new positions, and send me back the
ammunition wagons as he emptied them. The third I kept
with the centre section. The corporal clerk was to look
after the headquarters. I was to function between the lot.</p>

<p>The teams should have been up at 9 p.m. They
didn’t arrive till ten, by which time the gas hung about
thick, and people were sneezing right and left. Then
they hung up again because of a heavy shelling at the
corner on the way to the left section. However, they got
through at last, and after an endless wait, that excellent
sergeant came trotting back with both guns intact. We
had, meanwhile yanked out the centre section and sent
them back. The forward guns came back all right
from the trenches, but no ammunition wagons or G.S.
returned from the position, although filled by us ages
before and sent off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>So I got on a bicycle and rode along to see what the
trouble was. It was a poisonous road, pitch dark, very
wet and full of shell holes. I got there to find a column
of vehicles standing waiting all mixed up, jerked the
bicycle into a hedge and went downstairs to find the
subaltern.</p>

<p>There was the Major! Was I pleased?&mdash;I felt years
younger. However, this was his night off. I was
running the show. “Carry on, Old Thing,” said he.</p>

<p>So I went out into the chaotic darkness and began
sorting things out. Putting the subaltern in charge
of the ammunition I took the guns. It was a herculean
task to get those six bundooks through the wet and
spongy orchard with men who were fresh. With these
men it was asking the impossible. But they did it, at
the trot.</p>

<p>You know the sort of thing&mdash;“Take the strain&mdash;together&mdash;heave!
Together&mdash;heave! Now keep her
going! Once more&mdash;heave! Together&mdash;heave! and
again&mdash;heave! Easy all! Have a blow&mdash;Now look
here, you fellows, you <em>must</em> wait for the word and put
your weight on <em>together</em>. Heels into the mud and lean
on it, but lean together, all at the same moment, and
she’ll go like a baby’s pram. Now then, come on and
I’ll bet you a bottle of Bass all round that you get her
going at a canter if only you’ll heave together&mdash;Take
the strain&mdash;<em>together</em>&mdash;heave! Ter-rot! Canter! Come
on now, like that&mdash;splendid,&mdash;and you owe me a bottle
of Bass all round.”</p>

<p>Sounds easy, doesn’t it? but oh, my God, to see
those poor devils, dropping with fatigue, putting their
last grunting ounce on to it, with always just one more
heave left! Magnificent fellows, who worked till they
dropped, and then staggered up again, in the face of gas
and five-nines, and went on shooting till they were dead,&mdash;<em>they’ve</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
won this war for us if anybody has, these
Tommies who don’t know when they’re beaten, these
“simple soldiers,” as the French call them, who grouse
like hell but go on working whether the rations come
up or whether they don’t, until they’re senseless from
gas or stop a shell and get dropped into a hole in an army
blanket. These are the men who have saved England
and the world, these,&mdash;and not the gentlemen at home
who make fortunes out of munitions and “war work,”
and strike for more pay, not the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embusqué</i> who cannot
leave England because he’s “indispensable” to his job,
not the politicians and vote-seekers, who bolster up their
parties with comfortable lies more dangerous than
mustard gas, not the M.L.O.’s and R.T.O.’s and the
rest of the alphabetic fraternity and Brass Hats, who live
in comfort in back areas, doing a lot of brain work and
filling the Staff leave boat,&mdash;not any of these, but the
cursing, spitting, lousy Tommy, God save him!</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>The last of the guns was in by three o’clock in the
morning, but there wasn’t a stitch of camouflage in the
battery. However, I sent every last man to bed, having
my own ideas on the question of camouflage. The
subaltern and I went back to the house. The ammunition
was also unloaded and the last wagon just about
to depart. The servants had tea and sandwiches waiting,
a perfect godsend.</p>

<p>“What about tracks?” The Major cocked an eye
in my direction. He was fully dressed, lying on his
valise. I stifled a million yawns, and spoke round a
sandwich. “Old Thing and I are looking after that
when it gets light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Old Thing” was the centre section commander,
blinking like a tired owl, a far-away expression on his
face.</p>

<p>“And camouflage?” said the Major.</p>

<p>“Ditto,” said I.</p>

<p>The servants were told to call us in an hour’s time.
I was asleep before I’d put my empty tea-cup on the
ground. A thin grey light was creeping up when I was
roughly shaken. I put out a boot and woke Old Thing.
Speechless, we got up shivering, and went out. The
tracks through the orchard were feet deep.</p>

<p>We planted irregular branches and broke up the
wheel tracks. Over the guns was a roof of wire netting
which I’d had put up a day previously. Into these we
stuck trailing vine branches one by one, wet and cold.
The Major appeared in the middle of the operation and
silently joined forces. By half-past four the camouflage
was complete. Then the Major broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I’m going up to shoot ’em in,” he said.</p>

<p>Old Thing, dozing on a gun seat, woke with a start
and stared. He hadn’t been with the Major as long as I
had.</p>

<p>“D’you mind if one detachment does the whole
thing?” said I. “They’re all just about dead, but C’s
got a kick left.”</p>

<p>The Major nodded. Old Thing staggered away,
collected two signallers who looked like nothing human,
and woke up C sub-section. They came one by one,
like silent ghosts through the orchard, tripping over
stumps and branches, sightless with sleep denied.</p>

<p>The Major took a signaller and went away. Old Thing
and I checked aiming posts over the compass.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the O.P. rang through, and I
reported ready.</p>

<p>The sun came out warm and bright, and at nine o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
we “stood down.” Old Thing and I supported each
other into the house and fell on our valises with a laugh.
Some one pulled off our gum boots. It must have been
a servant but I don’t know. I was asleep before they
were off.</p>

<p>The raid came off at one o’clock that night in a pouring
rain. The gunners had been carrying ammunition all
day after about four hours’ sleep. Old Thing and I had
one. The Major didn’t have any. The barrage lasted an
hour and a half, during which one sub-section made a
ghastly mistake and shot for five full minutes on a wrong
switch.</p>

<p>A raid of any size is not just a matter of saying, “Let’s
go over the top to-night, and nobble a few of ’em!
Shall us?”</p>

<p>And the other fellow in the orthodox manner says,
“Let’s”&mdash;and over they go with a lot of doughty
bombers, and do a lot of dirty work. I wish it were.</p>

<p>What really happens is this. First, the Brigade Major,
quite a long way back, undergoes a brain-storm which
sends showers of typewritten sheets to all sorts of
Adjutants, who immediately talk of transferring to the
Anti-Aircraft. Other sheets follow in due course, contradicting
the first and giving also a long list of code words
of a domestic nature usually, with their key. These are
hotly pursued by maps on tracing paper, looking as
though drawn by an imaginative child.</p>

<p>At this point Group Commanders, Battalion Commanders,
and Battery Commanders join in the game,
taking sides. Battery Commanders walk miles and
miles daily along duck boards, and shoot wire in all sorts
of odd places on the enemy front trench, and work out
an exhaustive barrage.</p>

<p>Then comes a booklet, which is a sort of revision of all
that has gone before, and alters the task of every battery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
A new barrage table is worked out. Follows a single
sheet giving zero day.</p>

<p>The raiders begin cutting off their buttons and blacking
their faces and putting oil drums in position.</p>

<p>Battery wagon lines toil all night, bringing up countless
extra rounds. The trench mortar people then try and
cut the real bit of wire, at which the raiders will enter
the enemy front line. As a rule they are unsuccessful,
and only provoke a furious retaliatory bombardment
along the whole sector.</p>

<p>Then Division begins to get excited and talks rudely
to Group. Group passes it on. Next a field battery is
ordered to cut that adjective wire and does.</p>

<p>A Gunner officer is detailed to go over the top with the
raid commander. He writes last letters to his family,
drinks a last whisky, puts on all his Christmas-tree, and
says, “Cheero” as though going to his own funeral. It
may be.</p>

<p>Then telephones buzz furiously in every brigade, and
everybody says “Carrots” in a whisper.</p>

<p>You look up “Carrots” in the code book, and find
it means “raid postponed 24 hours.” Everybody sits
down and curses.</p>

<p>Another paper comes round saying that the infantry
have changed the colours of all the signal rockets to be
used. All gunners go on cursing.</p>

<p>Then comes the night! Come up to the O.P. and
have a dekko with me, but don’t forget to bring your
gas mask.</p>

<p>Single file we zigzag down the communication trenches.
The O.P. is a farmhouse, or was, in which the sappers
have built a brick chamber just under the roof. You
climb up a ladder to get to it, and find room for just the
signaller and ourselves, with a long slit through which
you can watch Germany. The Hun knows it’s an O.P.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
He’s got a similar one facing you, only built of concrete,
and if you don’t shell him he won’t shell you. But if
you do shell him with a futile 18-pounder H.E. or so, he
turns on a section of five-nines, and the best thing you
can do is to report that it’s “snowing,” clear out quick
and look for a new O.P. The chances are you won’t
find one that’s any good.</p>

<p>It’s frightfully dark; can’t see a yard. If you want
to smoke, for any sake don’t strike matches. Use a
tinder. See that sort of extra dark lump, just behind
those two trees&mdash;all right, poles if you like. They
<em>were</em> trees!&mdash;Well, that’s where they’re going over.</p>

<p>Not a sound anywhere except the rumble of a battle
away up north. Hell of a strafe apparently.</p>

<p>Hullo! What’s the light behind that bank of trees?&mdash;Fritz
started a fire in his own lines? Doesn’t look
like a fire.&mdash;It’s the moon coming up, moon, moon, so
brightly shining. Pity old Pelissier turned up his toes.&mdash;Ever
heard the second verse of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au Clair de la Lune</span>?”</p>

<p class="noindent">(singing)</p>

</div>

<p><em>’Tis</em> the moon all right, a corker too.&mdash;What do you
make the time?&mdash;A minute to go, eh? Got your gas
mask at the alert?</p>

<p>The moon came out above the trees and shed a cold
white light on the countryside. On our side, at least,
the ground was alive with men, although there wasn’t a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
sound or a movement. Tree stumps, blasted by shell
fire, stood out stark naked. The woods on the opposite
ridge threw a deep belt of black shadow. The trenches
were vague uneven lines, camouflaging themselves
naturally with the torn ground.</p>

<p>Then a mighty roar that rocked the O.P., made the
ground tremble and set one’s heart thumping, and the
peaceful moonlight was defiled. Bursts of flame and a
thick cloud of smoke broke out on the enemy trenches.
Great red flares shot up, the oil drums, staining all the
sky the colour of blood. Rifle and machine-gun fire
pattered like the chattering of a thousand monkeys,
as an accompaniment to the roaring of lions. Things
zipped past or struck the O.P. The smoke out there
was so thick that the pin-points of red fire made by the
bursting shells could hardly be seen. The raiders were
entirely invisible.</p>

<p>Then the noise increased steadily as the German sky
was splashed with all-coloured rockets and Verey lights
and star shells, and their S.O.S. was answered. There’s
a gun flash! What’s the bearing? Quick.&mdash;There
she goes again!&mdash;Nine-two magnetic, that’s eighty
true. Signaller! Group.&mdash;There’s another! By God,
that’s some gun. Get it while I bung this through.&mdash;Hullo!
Hullo, Group! O.P. speaking. Flash of enemy
gun eight&mdash;0 degrees true. Another flash, a hell of a
big one, what is it?&mdash;One, one, two degrees,&mdash;Yes, that’s
correct. Good-bye.</p>

<p>Then a mighty crash sent earth and duckboards
spattering on to the roof of the O.P., most unpleasantly
near. The signaller put his mouth to my ear and
shouted, “Brigade reports gas, sir.” Curse the gas.
You can’t see anything in a mask.&mdash;Don’t smell it yet,
anyhow.</p>

<p>Crash again, and the O.P. rocked. Damn that five-nine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Was he shooting us or just searching? Anyhow,
the line of the two bursts doesn’t look <em>quite</em> right for us,
do you think? If it hits the place, there’s not an earthly.
Tiles begin rattling down off the roof most suggestively.
It’s a good twenty-foot drop down that miserable ladder.
Do you think his line.&mdash;Look out! She’s coming.&mdash;Crash!</p>

<p>God, not more than twenty yards away! However,
we’re all right. He’s searching to the left of us. Where
<em>is</em> the blighter? Can you see his flash? Wonder how
our battery’s getting on?&mdash;</p>

<p>Our people were on the protective barrage now, much
slower. The infantry had either done their job or not.
Anyhow they were getting back. The noise was distinctly
tailing off. The five-nine was searching farther
and farther behind to our left. The smell of gas was
very faint. The smoke was clearing. Not a sign of
life in the trenches. Our people had ceased fire.</p>

<p>The Hun was still doing a ragged gun fire. Then he
stopped.</p>

<p>A Verey light or two went sailing over in a big arc.</p>

<p>The moon was just a little higher, still smiling inscrutably.
Silence, but for that sustained rumble up
north. How many men were lying crumpled in that
cold white light?</p>

<p>Division reported “Enemy front line was found to be
unoccupied. On penetrating his second line slight
resistance was encountered. One prisoner taken. Five
of the enemy were killed in trying to escape. Our
<ins class="corr" id="tn-169" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'causalties slight'">
casualties slight</ins>.”</p>

<p>At the end of our barrage I called that detachment up,
reduced three of them to tears and in awful gloom of
spirit reported the catastrophe to the Major. He passed
it on to Brigade who said they would investigate.</p>

<p>A day later Division sent round a report of the “highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
successful raid which from the adverse weather conditions
owed its success to the brilliance of the artillery
barrage....”</p>

<p>That same morning the Colonel went to Division, the
General was on leave. The Major was sent for to command
the Group, and my secret hopes of the wagon line
were dashed to the ground. I was a Battery Commander
again in deed if not in rank.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>The wagon line all this while had, in the charge of the
sergeant-major, been cursed most bitterly by horse
masters and A.D.V.S.’s who could not understand how
a sergeant-major, aged perhaps thirty-nine, could
possibly know as much about horse management as a
new-fledged subaltern anywhere between nineteen and
twenty-one.</p>

<p>From time to time I pottered down on a bicycle for
the purpose of strafing criminals and came away each
time with a prayer of thanks that there was no new-fledged
infant to interfere with the sergeant-major’s
methods.</p>

<p>On one occasion he begged me to wait and see an
A.D.V.S. of sorts who was due at two o’clock that
afternoon and who on his previous tour of inspection
had been just about as nasty as he could be. I
waited.</p>

<p>Let it be granted as our old enemy Euclid says that
the horse standings were the worst in France&mdash;the
Division of course had the decent ones&mdash;and that every
effort was being made to repair them. The number of
shelled houses removed bodily from the firing line to
make brick standings and pathways through the mud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
would have built a model village. The horses were
doing this work in addition to ammunition fatigues,
brigade fatigues and every other sort of affliction.
Assuming too that a sergeant-major doesn’t carry as
much weight as a Captain (I’d got my third pip) in confronting
an A.S.C. forage merchant with his iniquities,
and I think every knowledgeable person admitted that
our wagon line was as good as, if not better than, shall
we say, any Divisional battery. Yet the veterinary
expert (?) crabbed my very loyal supporter, the sergeant-major,
who worked his head and his hands off day in,
day out. It was displeasing,&mdash;more, childish.</p>

<p>In due course he arrived,&mdash;in a motor car. True, it
wasn’t a Rolls-Royce, but then he was only a Colonel.
But he wore a fur coat just as if it had been a Rolls-Royce.
He stepped delicately into the mud, and left his temper
in the car. To the man who travels in motors, a splash
of mud on the boots is as offensive as the sight of a man
smoking a pipe in Bond Street at eleven o’clock in the
morning. It isn’t done.</p>

<p>I saluted and gave him good morning. He grunted
and flicked a finger. Amicable relations were established.</p>

<p>“Are you in charge of these wagon lines?” said he.</p>

<p>“In theory, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>He didn’t quite understand, and cocked a doubtful
eye at me.</p>

<p>I explained. “You see, sir, the B.C. and I are carrying
on the war. He’s commanding Group and I’m
commanding the battery. But we’ve got the fullest
confidence in the sergeant-maj.&mdash;”</p>

<p>Was it an oath he swallowed? Anyhow, it went
down like an oyster.</p>

<p>The Colonel moved thus expressing his desire to look
round.</p>

<p>I fell into step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“Have you got a hay sieve?” said he.</p>

<p>“Sergeant-Major, where’s the hay sieve?” said I.</p>

<p>“This way, sir,” said the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>Two drivers were busily passing hay through it. The
Colonel told them how to do it.</p>

<p>“Have you got wire hay racks above the horses?”</p>

<p>“Sergeant-Major,” said I, “have we got wire hay
racks?”</p>

<p>“This way, sir,” said the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>Two drivers were stretching pieces of bale wire from
pole to pole.</p>

<p>The Colonel asked them if they knew how to do it.</p>

<p>“How many horses have you got for casting?” said
the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Do we want to cast any horses, Sergeant-Major?”
said I.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the Sergeant-Major. “We’ve got
six.”</p>

<p>It was a delightful morning. Every question that
the Colonel asked I passed on to the sergeant-major,
whose answer was ever ready. Wherever the Colonel
wished to explore, there were men working.</p>

<p>Could a new-fledged infant unversed in the ways of
the Army have accomplished it?</p>

<p>One of the sections was down the road, quite five
minutes away. During the walk we exchanged views
about the war. He confided to me that the ideal was
to have in each wagon line an officer who knew no more
about gunnery than that turnip, but who knew enough
about horses to take advice from veterinary officers.</p>

<p>In return I told him that there ought not to be any
wagon lines, that the horse was effete in a war of this
nature, that over half the man-power of the country was
employed in grooming and cleaning harness, half the
tonnage of the shipping taken up in fetching forage, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
that there was more strafing over a bad turn-out than if
a battery had shot its own infantry for four days
running.</p>

<p>The outcome of it all was pure farce. He inspected
the remaining section and then told me he was immensely
pleased with the marked improvement in the condition
of the animals and the horse management generally
(nothing had been altered), and that if I found myself
short of labour when it came to building a new wagon
line, he thought he knew where he could put his hand on
a dozen useful men. Furthermore, he was going to write
and tell my Colonel how pleased he was.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major’s face was a study!</p>

<p>The psychology of it is presumably the same that
brings promotion to the officer who, smartly and with
well-polished buttons, in reply to a question from the
General, “What colour is black?” whips out like a
flash, “White, sir!”</p>

<p>And the General nods and says, “Of course!&mdash;Smart
young officer that! What’s his name?”</p>

<p>Infallible!</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>It is difficult to mark the exact beginnings of mental
attitudes when time out there is one long action of nights
and days without names. One keeps the date, because
of the orders issued. For the rest it is all one. One can
only trace points of view, feelings, call them what you
will, as dating before or after certain outstanding events.
Thus I had no idea of war until the gas bombardment in
Armentières, no idea that human nature could go through
such experiences and emotions and remain sane. So,
once in action, I had not bothered to find the reason of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
it all, contenting myself merely with the profound conviction
that the world was mad, that it was against
human nature,&mdash;but that to-morrow we should want a
full <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échelon</span> of ammunition. Even the times when one
had seen death only gave one a momentary shock. One
such incident will never leave me, but I cannot feel now
anything of the horror I experienced at the moment.</p>

<p>It was at lunch one day before we had left the château.
A trickle of sun filtered down into the cellar where the
Major, one other subaltern and myself were lunching off
bully beef and ration pickles. Every now and again an
H.E. shell exploded outside, in the road along which
infantry were constantly passing. One burst was
followed by piercing screams. My heart gave a leap
and I sprang for the stairs and out. Across the way
lay three bodies, a great purple stain on the pavement,
the mark of a direct hit on the wall against which one
was huddled. I ran across. Their eyes were glassy,
their faces black. Grey fingers curled upwards from a
hand that lay back down. Then the screams came
again from the corner house. I dashed in. Our corporal
signaller was trying to bandage a man whose right leg
was smashed and torn open, blood and loose flesh everywhere.
He lay on his back, screaming. Other screams
came from round the corner. I went out again and
down the passage saw a man, his hands to his face, swaying
backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>I ran to him. “Are you hit?”</p>

<p>He fell on to me. “My foot! Oh, my foot!
Christ!”</p>

<p>Another officer, from the howitzer battery, came
running. We formed a bandy chair and began to carry
him up towards the road.</p>

<p>“Don’t take me up there,” he blubbered. “Don’t
take me there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>We had to. It was the only way, to step over those
three black-faced corpses and into that house, where
there was water and bandages. There was a padre
there now and another man. I left them and returned
to the cellar to telephone for an ambulance. I was cold,
sick. But they weren’t <em>our</em> dead. They weren’t our
gunners with whose faces one was familiar, who were
part of our daily life. The feeling passed, and I was
able to go on with the bully beef and pickles and the
war.</p>

<p>During the weeks that followed the last raid I was to
learn differently. They were harassing weeks with
guns dotted all over the zone. The luck seemed to have
turned, and it was next to impossible to find a place for
a gun which the Hun didn’t immediately shell violently.
Every gun had, of course, a different pin-point, and map
work became a labour, map work and the difficulty of
battery control and rationing. One’s brain was keyed
incessantly up to concert pitch.</p>

<p>Various changes had taken place. We had been
taken into Right Group and headquarters was established
in a practically unshelled farm with one section beside it.
Another section was right forward in the Brickstack.
The third was away on the other side of the zone, an
enfilade section which I handed over, lock, stock and
barrel, to the section commander, who had his own O.P.
in Moat Farm, and took on his own targets. We were
<ins class="corr" id="tn-175" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'all extremly happy'">
all extremely happy</ins>, doing a lot of shooting.</p>

<p>One morning, hot and sunny, I had to meet the Major
to reconnoitre an alternative gun position. So I sent
for the enfilade section commander to come and take
charge, and set out in shorts and shirt sleeves on a bicycle.
The Major, another Headquarters officer and myself had
finished reconnoitring, and were eating plums, when a
heavy bombardment began in the direction of the battery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
farm. Five-nines they were in section salvos, and the
earth went up in spouts, not on the farm, but mighty
close. I didn’t feel anxious at first, for that subaltern
had been in charge of the Chapelle section and knew all
about clearing out. But the bombardment went on.
The Major and the other left me, advising me to “give
it a chance” before I went back.</p>

<p>So I rode along to an O.P. and tried to get through
to the battery on the ’phone. The line was gone.</p>

<p>Through glasses I could see no signs of life round
about the farm. They must have cleared, I thought.
However, I had to get back some time or other, so I rode
slowly back along the road. A track led between open
fields to the farm. I walked the bicycle along this until
bits of shell began flying. I lay flat. Then the bombardment
slackened. I got up and walked on. Again
they opened, so I lay flat again.</p>

<p>For perhaps half an hour bits came zooming like
great stagbeetles all round, while I lay and watched.</p>

<p>They were on the gun position, not the farm, but
somehow my anxiety wouldn’t go. After all, I was in
charge of the battery, and here I was, while God knew
what might have happened in the farm. So I decided
to make a dash for it, and timed the bursts. At the end
of five minutes they slackened and I thought I could do
it. Two more crashed. I jumped on the bike, pedalled
hard down the track until it was blotted out by an
enormous shell hole into which I went, left the bike
lying and ran to the farm gate, just as two pip-squeaks
burst in the yard. I fell into the door, covered with
brick dust and tiles, but unhurt.</p>

<p>The sound of singing came from the cellar. I called
down, “Who’s there?” The servants and the corporal
clerk were there. And the officer? Oh, he’d gone over
to the guns to see if everybody had cleared the position.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
He’d given the order as soon as the bombardment
began. But over at the guns the place was being chewed
up.</p>

<p>Had he gone alone? No. One of the servants had
gone with him. How long ago? Perhaps twenty
minutes. Meanwhile, during question and answer, four
more pip-squeaks had landed, two at the farm gate, one
in the yard, one just over.</p>

<p>It was getting altogether too hot. I decided to clear
the farm first. Two at a time, taking the word from
me, they made a dash for it through the garden and the
hedge to a flank, till only the corporal clerk and myself
were left. We gathered the secret papers the “wind
gadget,” my compass and the telephone and ran for it
in our turn.</p>

<p>We caught the others who were waiting round the
corner well to a flank. I handed the things we’d brought
to the mess cook, and asked the corporal clerk if he’d
come with me to make sure that the subaltern and the
gunners had got away all right.</p>

<p>We went wide and got round to the rear of the position.
Not a sign of any of the detachments in any houses round
about. Then we worked our way up a hedge which led
to the rear of the guns, dropping flat for shells to burst.
They were more on the farm now than the guns. We
reached the signal pit,&mdash;a sort of dug-out with a roof
of pit props, and earth and a trench dug to the entrance.</p>

<p>The corporal went along the trench. “Christ!” he
said, and came blindly back.</p>

<p>For an instant the world spun. Without seeing I saw.
Then I climbed along the broken trench. A five-nine
had landed on the roof of the pit and crashed everything
in.</p>

<p>A pair of boots was sticking out of the earth.&mdash;</p>

<p>He had been in charge of the battery for <em>me</em>. From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
the safety of the cellar he had gone out to see if the men
were all right. He had done <em>my</em> job!</p>

<p>Gunners came with shovels. In five minutes we had
him out. He was still warm. The doctor was on his
way. We carried him out of the shelling on a duck
board. Some of the gunners went on digging for the
other boy. The doctor was there by the time we’d
carried him to the road. He was dead.</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>A pair of boots sticking out of the earth.</p>

<p>For days I saw nothing else. That jolly fellow whom
I’d left laughing, sitting down to write a letter to his
wife,&mdash;a pair of boots sticking out. Why? Why?</p>

<p>We had laid him in a cottage. The sergeant and I
went back, and by the light of a candle which flickered
horribly, emptied his pockets and took off his ring. How
cold Death was. It made him look ten years younger.</p>

<p>Then we put him into an army blanket with his boots
on and all his clothes. The only string we had was
knotted. It took a long time to untie it. At last it
was done.</p>

<p>A cigarette holder, a penknife, a handkerchief, the
ring. I took them out with me into the moonlight, all
that King and country had left of him.</p>

<p>What had this youngster been born for, sent to a
Public School, earned his own living and married the
pretty girl whose photo I had seen in the dug-out?
To die like a rat in a trap, to have his name one day in
the Roll of Honour and so break two hearts, and then be
forgotten by his country because he was no more use to
it. What was the worth of Public School education<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
if it gave the country no higher ideal than war?&mdash;to
kill or be killed. Were there no brains in England big
enough to avert it? He hadn’t wanted it. He was a
representative specimen. What had he joined for?
Because all his pals had. He didn’t want them to call
him coward. For that he had left his wife and his home,
and to-morrow he would be dropped into a hole in the
ground and a parson would utter words about God and
eternal life.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Why, because it was the
“thing to do,” did we all join up like sheep in a Chicago
packing yard? What right had our country&mdash;the
“free country”&mdash;to compel us to live this life of filth
and agony?</p>

<p>The men who made the law that sent us out, <ins class="corr" id="tn-179" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'they dind’t come'">
they didn’t come</ins> too. They were the “rudder of the nation,”
steering the “Ship of State.” They’d never seen a pair
of boots sticking out of the earth. Why did we bow
the neck and obey other men’s wills?</p>

<p>Surely these conscientious objectors had a greater
courage in withstanding our ridicule than we in wishing
to prove our possession of courage by coming out. What
was the root of this war,&mdash;honour? How can honour
be at the root of dishonour, and wholesale manslaughter?
What kind of honour was it that smashed up homesteads,
raped women, crucified soldiers, bombed hospitals,
bayoneted wounded? What idealism was ours if we
took an eye for an eye? What was our civilization, twenty
centuries of it, if we hadn’t reached even to the barbaric
standards,&mdash;for no barbarian could have invented
these atrocities. What was the festering pit on which
our social system was built?</p>

<p>And the parson who talked of God,&mdash;is there more
than one God, then, for the Germans quoted him as being
on their side with as much fervour and sincerity as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
parson? How reconcile any God with this devastation
and deliberate killing? This war was the proof of the
failure of Christ, the proof of our own failure, the failure
of the civilized world. For twenty centuries the world
had turned a blind eye to the foulness stirring inside it,
insinuating itself into the main arteries; and now the lid
was wrenched off and all the foul stench of a humbug
Christian civilization floated over the poisoned world.</p>

<p>One man had said he was too proud to fight. We,
filled with the lust of slaughter, jeered him as we had
jeered the conscientious objectors. But wasn’t there
in our hearts, in saner moments, a respect which we were
ashamed to admit,&mdash;because we in our turn would have
been jeered at? Therein lay our cowardice. Death
we faced daily, hourly, with a laugh. But the ridicule
of our fellow cowards, that was worse than death. And
yet in our knowledge we cried aloud for Peace, who in
our ignorance had cried for War. Children of impulse
satiated with new toys and calling for the old ones! We
would set back the clock and in our helplessness called
upon the Christ whom we had crucified.</p>

<p>And back at home the law-makers and the old men
shouted patriotically from their club fenders, “We will
fight to the last man!”</p>

<p>The utter waste of the brown-blanketed bundle in the
cottage room!</p>

<p>What would I not have given for the one woman
to put her arms round me and hide my face against
her breast and let me sob out all the bitterness in my
heart?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>


<h3>15</h3>

<p>From that moment I became a conscientious objector,
a pacifist, a most bitter hater of the Boche whose hand
it was that had wrenched the lid off the European cesspit.
Illogical? If you like, but what is logic? Logically
the war was justified. We crucified Christ logically and
would do so again.</p>

<p>From that moment my mind turned and twisted
like a compass needle that had lost its sense of the
north. The days were an endless burden blackened
by the shadow of death, filled with emptiness, bitterness
and despair.</p>

<p>The day’s work went on as if nothing had happened.
A new face took his place at the mess table, the routine
was exactly the same. Only a rough wooden cross
showed that he had ever been with us. And all the time
we went on shooting, killing just as good fellows as he,
perhaps, doing our best to do so at least. Was it honest,
thinking as I did? Is it honest for a convict who doesn’t
believe in prisons to go on serving his time? There was
nothing to be done but go on shooting and try and
forget.</p>

<p>But war isn’t like that. It doesn’t let you forget.
It gives you a few days, or weeks, and then takes some
one else. “Old Thing” was the next, in the middle
of a shoot in a front line O.P.</p>

<p>I was lying on my bed playing with a tiny kitten
while the third subaltern at the ’phone passed on the
corrections to the battery. Suddenly, instead of saying
“Five minutes more right,” he said, “<em>What’s</em> that?&mdash;Badly
wounded?” and the line went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>I was on the ’phone in a flash, calling up battalion
for stretcher bearers and doctors.</p>

<p>They brought me his small change and pencil-ends
and pocketbook,&mdash;and the kitten came climbing up my
leg.</p>

<p>The Major came back from leave&mdash;which he had got
on the Colonel’s return&mdash;in time to attend Old Thing’s
funeral with the Colonel and myself. Outside the cemetery
a football match was going on all the time. They
didn’t stop their game. Why should they? They were
too used to funerals,&mdash;and it might be their turn in a
day or two.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Major my leave came through within
a week. It was like the answer to a prayer. At any
price I wanted to get away from the responsibility, away
from the sight of khaki, away from everything to do with
war.</p>

<p>London was too full of it, of immaculate men and filmy
girls who giggled. I couldn’t face that.</p>

<p>I went straight down to the little house among the
beeches and pines,&mdash;an uneasy guest of long silences,
staring into the fire, of bursts of violent argument, of
rebellion against all existing institutions.</p>

<p>But it was good to watch the river flowing by, to
hear it lapping against the white yacht, to hear the
echo of rowlocks, flung back by the beech woods, and
the wonderful whir! whir! whir! of swans as they
flew down and down and away; to see little cottages
with wisps of blue smoke against the brown and purple
of the distant woods, not lonely ruins and sticks; to
see the feathery green moss and the watery rays of a
furtive sun through the pines, not smashed and torn by
shells; at night to watch the friendly lights in the curtained
windows and hear the owls hooting to each other
unafraid and let the rest and peace sink into one’s soul;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
to shirk even the responsibility of deciding whether one
should go for a walk or out in the dinghy, or stay indoors,
but just to agree to anything that was suggested.</p>

<p>To decide anything was for out there, not here where
war did not enter in.</p>

<p>Fifteen dream days, like a sudden strong whiff of
verbena or honeysuckle coming out of an envelope.
For the moment one shuts one’s eyes,&mdash;and opens
them again to find it isn’t true. The sound of guns
is everywhere.</p>

<p>So with that leave. I found myself in France again,
trotting up in the mud and rain to report my arrival as
though I’d never been away. It was all just a dream to
try and call back.</p>


<h3>16</h3>

<p>Everything was well with the battery. My job was
to function with all speed at the building of the new
horse lines. Before going on leave I had drawn a map
to scale of the field in which they were to be. This had
been submitted to Corps and approved, and work had
started on it during my leave.</p>

<p>My kit followed me and I installed myself in a small
canvas hut with the acting-Captain of another of our
batteries whose lines were belly deep in the next field.
He had succeeded Pip Don who went home gassed after
the Armentières shelling and <ins class="corr" id="tn-183" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'who, on rcovering'">
who, on recovering</ins>, had been sent out to Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>The work was being handled under rather adverse
conditions. Some of the men were from our own battery,
others from the Brigade Ammunition Column, more
from a Labour Company, and there was a full-blown
Sapper private doing the scientific part. They were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
all at loggerheads; none of the N.C.O.’s would take
orders from the Sapper private, and the Labour Company
worked Trades Union hours, although dressed in khaki
and calling themselves soldiers. The subaltern in
charge was on the verge of putting every one of them
under arrest,&mdash;not a bad idea, but what about the
standings?</p>

<p>By the time I’d had a look round tea was ready.
At least there seemed to be plenty of material.</p>

<p>At seven next morning I was out. No one else was.
So I took another look round, did a little thinking, and
came and had breakfast. By nine o’clock there seemed
to be a lot of cigarette smoke in the direction of the works.</p>

<p>I began functioning. My servant summoned all the
heads of departments and they appeared before me in
a sullen row. At my suggestion tongues wagged freely
for about half an hour. I addressed them in their own
language and then, metaphorically speaking, we shook
hands all round, sang hymn number 44 and standings
suddenly began to spring up like mushrooms.</p>

<p>It was really extraordinary how those fellows worked
once they’d got the hang of the thing. It left me free
to go joy-riding with my stable companion in the afternoons.
We carried mackintoshes on the saddle and
scoured the country, splashing into Bailleul&mdash;it was odd
to revisit the scene of my trooper days after three years&mdash;for
gramophone records, smokes, stomachic delicacies
and books. We also sunk a lot of francs in a series of
highly artistic picture postcards which, pinned all round
the hut at eye level, were a constant source of admiration
and delight to the servants and furnished us with a splash
of colour which at least broke the monotony of khaki
canvas. These were&mdash;it goes without saying&mdash;supplemented
from time to time with the more reticent efforts
of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vie Parisienne</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>All things being equal we were extremely comfortable,
and, although the stove was full of surprises, quite sufficiently
frowzy during the long evenings, which were filled
with argument, invention, music and much tobacco.
The invention part of the programme was supplied by
my stable companion who had his own theories concerning
acetylene lamps, and who, with the aid of a couple
of shell cases and a little carbide nearly wrecked the
happy home. Inventions were therefore suppressed.</p>

<p>They were tranquil days, in which we built not only
book shelves, stoves and horse standings but a great
friendship,&mdash;ended only by his death on the battlefield.
He was all for the gun line and its greater strenuousness.</p>

<p>As for me, then, at least, I was content to lie fallow.
I had seen too much of the guns, thanked God for the
opportunity of doing something utterly different for a
time and tried to conduct a mental spring-clean and rearrangement.
As a means to this I found myself putting
ideas on paper in verse&mdash;a thing I’d never done <ins class="corr" id="tn-185" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'in all my live'">
in all my life</ins>&mdash;bad stuff but horribly real. One’s mind was tied
to war, like a horse on a picketing rope, and could only
go round and round in a narrow circle. To break away
was impossible. One was saturated with it as the country
was with blood. Every cog in the machinery of war
was like a magnet which held one in spite of all one’s
struggles, giddy with the noise, dazed by its enormity,
nauseated by its results.</p>

<p>The work provided one with a certain amount of comic
relief. Timber ran short and it seemed as if the standings
would be denied completion. Stones, gravel and cinders
had been already a difficulty, settled only by much importuning.
Bricks had been brought from the gun line.
But asking for timber was like trying to steal the chair
from under the General. I went to Division and was
promptly referred to Corps, who were handling the job.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Corps said, “You’ve had all that’s allowed in the R.E.
handbook. Good morning.” I explained that I wanted
it for wind screens. They smiled politely and suggested
my getting some ladies’ fans from any deserted village.
On returning to Division they said, “If Corps can’t help
you, how the devil can you expect us to?”</p>

<p>I went to Army. They looked me over and asked
me where I came from and who I was, and what I was
doing, and what for and on what authority, and why
I came to them instead of going to Division and Corps?
To all of which I replied patiently. Their ultimate answer
was a smile of regret. There wasn’t any in the country,
they said.</p>

<p>So I prevailed upon my brother who, as War Correspondent,
ran a big car and no questions asked about petrol,
to come over and lunch with me. To him I put the
case and was immediately whisked off to O.C. Forests,
the Timber King. At the lift of his little finger down
came thousands of great oaks. Surely a few branches
were going begging?</p>

<p>He heard my story with interest. His answer threw
beams of light. “Why the devil don’t Division and Corps
and all the rest of them <em>ask</em> for it if they want it? I’ve
got tons of stuff here. How much do you want?”</p>

<p>I told him the cubic stature of the standings.</p>

<p>He jotted abstruse calculations for a moment.
“Twenty tons,” said he. “Are you anywhere <ins class="corr" id="tn-186" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'near  he river'">
near the river</ins>”?</p>

<p>The river flowed at the bottom of the lines.</p>

<p>“Right. I’ll send you a barge. To-day’s Monday.
Should be with you by Wednesday. Name? Unit?”</p>

<p>He ought to have been commanding an army, that man.</p>

<p>We lunched most triumphantly in Hazebrouck, <ins class="corr" id="tn-186a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'had  ea and dinner'">
had tea and dinner</ins> at Cassel and I was dropped on my own
doorstep well before midnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>It was not unpleasing to let drop, quite casually of
course, to Division and Corps and Army, that twenty
tons of timber were being delivered at my lines in three
days and that there was more where that came from. If
they wanted any, they had only to come and ask <em>me</em>
about it.</p>


<h3>17</h3>

<p>During this period the Major had handed over the
eighteen-pounders, receiving 4.5 howitzers in exchange,
nice little cannons, but apparently in perpetual need of
calibration. None of the gunners had ever handled them
before but they picked up the new drill with extraordinary
aptitude, taking the most unholy delight in firing gas
shells. They hadn’t forgotten Armentières either.</p>

<p>My wagon line repose was roughly broken into by an
order one afternoon to come up immediately. The
Colonel was elsewhere and the Major had taken his place
once more.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a raid was to take place the same night
and I hadn’t the foggiest idea of the numberless 4.5
differences. However we did our share in the raid and
at the end of a couple of days I began to hope we should
stick to howitzers. The reasons were many,&mdash;a bigger
shell with more satisfactory results, gas as well as H.E.,
four guns to control instead of six, far greater ease in
finding positions and a longer range. This was in October,
’17. Things have changed since then. The air recuperator
with the new range drum and fuse indicator
have made the 18-pounder a new thing.</p>

<p>Two days after my going up the Hun found us. Between
11 a.m. and 4 p.m. he sent over three hundred
five-nines, but as they fell between two of the guns and
the billet, and he didn’t bother to switch, we were per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>fectly
happy. To my way of thinking his lack of imagination
in gunnery is one of the factors which has helped him
to lose the war. He is consistent, amazingly thorough
and amazingly accurate. We have those qualities too,
not quite so marked perhaps, but it is the added touch of
imagination, of sportingness, which has beaten him.
What English subaltern for instance up in that Hun
O.P. wouldn’t have given her five minutes more right for
luck,&mdash;and got the farm and the gun and the ammunition?
But because the Boche had been allotted a
definite target and a definite number of rounds he just
went on according to orders and never thought of budging
off his line. We all knew it and remained in the farm
although the M.P.I. was only fifty yards to a flank.</p>

<p>The morning after the raid I went the round of the
guns. One of them had a loose breechblock. When fired
the back flash was right across the gun pit. I put the
gun out of action, the chances being that very soon she
would blow out her breech and kill every man in the
detachment.</p>

<p>As my knowledge was limited to eighteen-pounders,
however, I sent for the brigade artificer. His opinion
confirmed mine.</p>

<p>That night she went down on the tail of a wagon.
The next night she came back again, the breech just as
loose. Nothing had been done. The Ordnance workshop
sent a chit with her to say she’d got to fire so many
hundred more rounds at 4th charge before she could be
condemned.</p>

<p>What was the idea? Surely to God the Hun killed
enough gunners without our trying to kill them ourselves?
Assuming that a 4.5 cost fifteen hundred
pounds in round figures, four gunners and a sergeant
at an average of two shillings a day were worth economising,
to say nothing of the fact that they were all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
trained men and experienced soldiers, or to mention
that they were human beings with wives and families.
It cannot have been the difficulty of getting another
gun. The country was stiff with guns and it only takes
a busy day to fire four hundred rounds.</p>

<p>It was just the good old system again! I left the
gun out of action.</p>

<p>Within a couple of days we had to hand over again.
We were leaving that front to go up into the salient,
Ypres. But I didn’t forget to tell the in-coming Battery
Commander all about that particular gun.</p>

<p>Ypres! One mentions it quite casually but I don’t
think there was an officer or man who didn’t draw a deep
breath when the order came. It was a death trap.</p>

<p>There was a month’s course of gunnery in England
about to take place,&mdash;the Overseas Course for Battery
Commanders. My name had been sent in. It was at
once cancelled so that the Ypres move was a double
disappointment.</p>

<p>So the battery went down to the wagon line and
prepared for the worst. For a couple of days we hung
about uneasily. Then the Major departed for the north
in a motor lorry to take over positions. Having seen him
off we foregathered with the officers of the Brigade Ammunition
Column, cursed with uneasy laughter and turned
the rum-specialist on to brewing flaming toddy.</p>

<p>The next day brought a telegram from the Major
of which two words at least will never die: “Move
cancelled.”</p>

<p>We had dinner in Estaires that night!</p>

<p>But the brigade was going to move, although none
of us knew where. The day before they took the road
I left for England in a hurry to attend the Overseas
Course. How little did I guess what changes were destined
to take place before I saw them again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>


<h3>18</h3>

<p>The course was a godsend in that it broke the back
of the winter. A month in England, sleeping between
sheets, with a hot bath every day and brief week-ends
with one’s people was a distinct improvement on France,
although the first half of the course was dull to desperation.
The chief interest, in fact, of the whole course
was to see the fight between the two schools of gunners,&mdash;the
theoretical and the practical. Shoebury was the
home of the theoretical. We filled all the Westcliff hotels
and went in daily by train to the school of gunnery, there
to imbibe drafts of statistics&mdash;not excluding our old
friend T.O.B.&mdash;and to relearn all the stuff we had been
doing every day in France in face of the Hun, a sort of
revised up-to-date version, including witty remarks
at the expense of Salisbury which left one with the idea,
“Well, if this is the last word of <em>the</em> School of Gunnery,
I’m a damned sight better gunner than I thought I was.”</p>

<p>Many of the officers had brought their wives down.
Apart from them the hotels were filled with indescribable
people,&mdash;dear old ladies in eighteenth-century garments
who knitted and talked scandal and allowed their giggling
daughters to flirt and dance with all and sundry. One
or two of the more advanced damsels had left their parents
behind and were staying there with “uncles,”&mdash;rather
lascivious-looking old men, rapidly going bald. Where
they all came from is a mystery. One didn’t think
England contained such people, and the thought that one
was fighting for them was intolerable.</p>

<p>After a written examination which was somewhat
of a farce at the end of the first fortnight, we all trooped
down to Salisbury to see the proof of the pudding in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
shooting. Shoebury was routed. A couple of hundred
bursting shells duly corrected for temperature, barometer,
wind and the various other disabilities attaching to
exterior ballistics will disprove the most likely-sounding
theory.</p>

<p>Salisbury said, “Of course they will tell you <em>this</em>
at Shoebury. They may be perfectly right. I don’t
deny it for a moment, but I’ll show you what the ruddy
bundook says about it.” And at the end of half an hour’s
shooting the “ruddy bundook” behind us had entirely
disposed of the argument. We had calibrated that unfortunate
battery to within half a foot a second, fired it
with a field clinometer, put it through its paces in snow-storms
and every kind of filthy weather and went away
impressed. The gun does not lie. Salisbury won hands
down.</p>

<p>The verdict of the respective schools upon my work
was amusing and showed that at least they had fathomed
the psychology of me.</p>

<p>Shoebury said, “Fair. A good second in command.”
Salisbury said, “Sound practical work. A good Battery
Commander.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the papers every day had been ringing
with the Cambrai show. November, ’17, was a memorable
month for many others besides the brigade. Of course
I didn’t know for certain that we were in it, but it wasn’t
a very difficult guess. The news became more and more
anxious reading, especially when I received a letter from
the Major who said laconically that he had lost all his
kit; would I please collect some more that he had ordered
and bring it out with me?</p>

<p>This was countermanded by a telegram saying he was
coming home on leave. I met him in London and in
the luxury of the Carlton Grill he told me the amazing
story of Cambrai.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>The net result to the brigade was the loss of the guns
and many officers and men, and the acquiring of one
D.S.O. which should have been a V.C., and a handful
of M.C.’s, Military Medals, and Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>I found them sitting down, very merry and bright,
at a place called Poix in the Lines of Communication,
and there I listened to stories of Huns shot with rifles
at one yard, of days in trenches fighting as infantry, of
barrages that passed conception, of the amazing feats
of my own Major who was the only officer who got nothing
out of it,&mdash;through some gross miscarriage of justice and
to my helpless fury.</p>

<p>There was a new Captain commanding my battery
in the absence of the Major. But I was informed that I
had been promoted Major and was taking over another
battery whose commander had been wounded in the
recent show. Somehow it had happened that that battery
and ours had always worked together, had almost always
played each other in the finals of brigade football matches
and there was as a result a strong liking between the two.
It was good therefore to have the luck to go to them instead
of one of the others. It completed the entente between
the two of us.</p>

<p>Only the Brigade Headquarters was in Poix. The
batteries and the Ammunition Column had a village each
in the neighbourhood. My new battery, my first command,
was at Bergicourt, some three miles away, and
thither I went in the brigade trap, a little shy and overwhelmed
at this entirely unexpected promotion, not quite
sure of my reception. The Captain was an older man
than I, and he and some of the subalterns had all been
lieutenants together with me in the Heytesbury days.</p>

<p>From the moment of getting out of the trap, as midday
stables was being dismissed, the Captain’s loyalty
to me was of the most exceptional kind. He did every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>thing
in his power to help me the whole time I remained
in command, and I owe him more gratitude and thanks
than I can ever hope to repay. The subalterns too
worked like niggers, and I was immensely proud of being
in command of such a splendid fighting battery.</p>

<p>Bergicourt was a picturesque little place that had
sprung up in a hillside cup. A tiny river ran at the
bottom of the hill, the cottages were dotted with charming
irregularity up and down its flank and the surrounding
woody hills protected it a little from the biting winter
winds. The men and horses were billeted among the
cottages. The battery office was in the Mairie, and the
mess was in the presbytery. The Abbé was a diminutive,
round-faced, blue-chinned little man with a black
skull cap, whose simplicity was altogether exceptional.
He had once been on a Cook’s tour to Greece, Egypt
and Italy but for all the knowledge of the world he got
from it he might as well have remained in Bergicourt.
He shaved on Sundays and insinuated himself humbly
into the mess room&mdash;his best parlour&mdash;with an invariable
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonjour, mon commandant!</i>” and a “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je vous remerc&mdash;ie</i>,”
that became the passwords of the battery. The
S sound in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">remercie</i> lasted a full minute to a sort of splashing
accompaniment emerging from the teeth. We used
to invite him in to coffee and liqueurs after dinner and
his round-eyed amazement when the Captain and one
of the subalterns did elementary conjuring tricks, producing
cards from the least expected portions of his
anatomy and so on as he sat there in front of the fire
with a drink in his hand and a cigarette smouldering in
his fingers, used to send us into helpless shrieks of laughter.</p>

<p>He bestowed on me in official moments the most
wonderful title, that even Haig might have been proud of.
He called me “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Commandant des armées
anglaises à Bergicourt</i>,”&mdash;a First Command indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>Christmas Day was a foot deep in snow, wonderfully
beautiful and silent with an almost canny stillness. The
Colonel and the Intelligence Officer came and had dinner
with us in the middle of the day, after the Colonel had
made a little speech to the men, who were sitting down
to theirs, and been cheered to the echo.</p>

<p>At night there was a concert and the battery got royally
tight. It was the first time they’d been out of action
for eight months and it probably did them a power of
good.</p>

<p>Four Christmases back I had been in Florida splashing
about in the sea, revelling in being care free, deep in the
writing of a novel. It was amazing how much water
had flowed under the bridges since then,&mdash;one in Fontainehouck,
one in Salonica, one in London, and now this one
at Bergicourt with six guns and a couple of hundred men
under me. I wondered where the next would be and
thought of New York with a sigh. If anyone had told
me in Florida that I should ever be a Major in the British
Army I should have thought he’d gone mad.</p>


<h3>19</h3>

<p>The time was spent in Poix in completing ourselves
with all the things of which the batteries were short&mdash;technical
stores&mdash;in making rings in the snow and exercising
the horses, in trying to get frost nails without
success, in a comic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasse au sanglier</i> organised by a local
sportsman in which we saw nothing but a big red fox
and a hare and bagged neither, in endeavouring to camouflage
the fuel stolen by the men, in wondering what 1918
would bring forth.</p>

<p>The bitter cold lasted day after day without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
sign of a break and in the middle of it came the order
to move. We were wanted back in the line again.</p>

<p>I suppose there is always one second of apprehension
on receiving that order, of looking round with the
thought, “Whose turn this time?” There seemed to
be no hope or sign of peace. The very idea was so
remote as to be stillborn. Almost it seemed as if one
would have to go on and on for ever. The machine
had run away with us and there was no stopping it.
Every calendar that ran out was another year of one’s
youth burnt on the altar of war. There was no future.
How could there be when men were falling like leaves in
autumn?</p>

<p>One put up a notice board on the edge of the future.
It said, “Trespassers will be pip-squeaked.” The present
was the antithesis of everything one had ever dreamed,
a ghastly slavery to be borne as best one could. One
sought distractions to stop one’s thinking. Work was
insufficient. One developed a literary gluttony, devouring
cannibalistically all the fiction writers, the war poets,
everything that one could lay hands on, developing unconsciously
a higher criticism, judging by the new standards
set by three years of war&mdash;that school of post-impressionism
that rubs out so ruthlessly the essential,
leaving the unessential crowing on its dunghill. It only
left one the past as a mental playground and even there
the values had altered. One looked back with a different
eye from that with which one had looked forward only
four years ago. One had seen Death now and heard
Fear whispering, and felt the pulse of a world upheaved
by passions.</p>

<p>The war itself had taken on a different aspect. The
period of peace sectors was over. Russia had had enough.
Any day now would see the released German divisions
back on the western front. It seemed that the new year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
must inevitably be one of cataclysmic events. It was
not so much “can we attack?” as “will they break
through?” And yet trench warfare had been a stalemate
for so long that it didn’t seem possible that they could.
But whatever happened it was not going to be a joy-ride.</p>

<p>We were going to another army. That at least was
a point of interest. The batteries, being scattered over
half a dozen miles of country, were to march independently
to their destinations. So upon the appointed day
we packed up and said good-bye to the little priest and
interviewed the mayor and haggled over exorbitant claims
for damages and impossible thefts of wood and potatoes,
wondering all the while how the horses would ever
stand up on the frozen roads without a single frost nail
in the battery. It was like a vast skating rink and the
farrier had been tearing his hair for days.</p>

<p>But finally the last team had slithered down to the gun
park, hooked in and everything was reported ready.
Billeting parties had gone on ahead.</p>

<p>It is difficult to convey just what that march meant.
It lasted four days, once the blizzard being so thick and
blinding that the march was abandoned, the whole
brigade remaining in temporary billets. The pace was a
crawl. The team horses slid into each other and fell,
the leads bringing the centres down, at every twenty
yards or so. The least rise had to be navigated by improvising
means of foothold&mdash;scattering a near manure
heap, getting gunners up with picks and shovels and
hacking at the road surface, assisting the horses with
drag-ropes&mdash;and all the time the wind was like a razor
on one’s face, and the drivers up on the staggering horses
beat their chests with both arms and changed over with
the gunners when all feeling had gone from their limbs.
Hour after hour one trekked through the blinding white,
silent country, stamping up and down at the halts with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
an anxious eye on the teams, chewing bully beef and
biscuits and thanking God for coffee piping hot out of a
thermos in the middle of the day. Then on again in the
afternoon while the light grew less and dropped finally
to an inky grey and the wind grew colder,&mdash;hoping that the
G.S. wagons, long since miles behind, would catch up.
Hour after hour stiff in the saddle with icy hands and feet,
one’s neck cricked to dodge the wind, or sliding off
stiffly to walk and get some warmth into one’s aching
limbs, the straps and weight of one’s equipment becoming
more and more irksome and heavy with every step forward
that slipped two back. To reach the destination
at all was lucky. To get there by ten o’clock at night
was a godsend, although watering the horses and feeding
them in the darkness with frozen fingers that burned on
straps and buckles drew strange Scotch oaths. For the
men, shelter of sorts, something at least with a roof
where a fire was lit at risk of burning the whole place
down. For the officers sometimes a peasant’s bed, or
valises spread on the floor, unpacking as little as possible
for the early start on the morning, the servants cooking
some sort of a meal, either on the peasant’s stove or over
a fire of sticks.</p>

<p>The snow came again and one went on next day,
blinded by the feathery touch of flakes that closed one’s
eyes so gently, crept down one’s neck and pockets,
lodged heavily in one’s lap when mounted, clung in a
frozen garment to one’s coat when walking, hissed softly
on one’s pipe and made one giddy with the silent, whirling,
endless pattern which blotted out the landscape, great
flakes like white butterflies, soft, velvety, beautiful but
also like little hands that sought to stop one persistently,
insidiously. “Go back,” said their owner, “go back.
We have hidden the road and the ditches and all the
country. We have closed your eyelids and you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
see. Go back before you reach that mad place where
we have covered over silent things that once were men,
trying to give back beauty to the ugliness that you
have made. Why do you march on in spite of us?
Do you seek to become as they? Go back. Go back,”
they whispered.</p>

<p>But we pushed blindly through, stumbling to another
billet to hear that the snow had stalled the motor lorries
and therefore there were no rations for the men and that
the next day’s march was twenty miles.</p>

<p>During the night a thaw set in. Snowflakes turned
to cold rain and in the dawn the men splashed, shivering,
and harnessed the shivering horses. One or two may
have drunk a cup of coffee given them by the villagers.
The rest knew empty stomachs as well as shivering. The
village had once been in the war zone and only old women
and children clung precariously to life. They had no
food to give or sell. The parade was ordered for six o’clock.
Some of the rear wagons, in difficulties with teams, had
not come in till the dawn, the Captain and all of them
having shared a biscuit or two since breakfast. But at
six the battery was reported ready and not a man was
late or sick. The horses had been in the open all night.</p>

<p>So on we went again with pools of water on the icy
crust of the road, the rain dripping off our caps. Would
there be food at the other end? Our stomachs cried out
for it.</p>

<p>And back in England full-fed fathers hearing the
rain splashing against the windows put an extra coal
on the fire, crying again, “We will fight to the last man!”;
railway men and munitioners yelled, “Down tools!
We need more pay!” and the Government flung our purses
to them and said, “Help yourselves&mdash;of course we shall
count on you to keep us in power at the next election.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>


<h3>20</h3>

<p>The village of Chuignolles, ice-bound, desolate, wood-patched
was our destination. The battles of the Somme
had passed that way, wiping everything out. Old shell
holes were softened with growing vegetation. Farm
cottages were held together by bits of corrugated iron.
The wind whistled through them, playing ghostly tunes
on splintered trunks that once had been a wood.</p>

<p>Two prison camps full of Germans, who in some
mysterious way knew that we had been in the Cambrai
push and commented about it as we marched in, were
the only human beings, save the village schoolmaster
and his wife and child, in whose cottage we shared a billet
with a Canadian forester. The schoolmaster was minus
one arm, the wife had survived the German occupation,
and the child was a golden-haired boy full of laughter,
with tiny teeth, blue eyes and chubby fingers that curled
round his mother’s heart. The men were lodged under
bits of brick wall and felting that constituted at least
shelter, and warmed themselves with the timber that the
Canadian let them remove from his Deccaville train which
screamed past the horse lines about four or five times a
day. They had stood the march in some marvellous way
that filled me with speechless admiration. Never a
grouse about the lack of rations, or the awful cold and wet,
always with a song on their lips they had paraded to time
daily, looked after the horses with a care that was almost
brotherly, put up with filthy billets and the extremes of
discomfort with a readiness that made me proud. What
kept them going? Was it that vague thing patriotism,
the more vague because the war wasn’t in their own
country? Was it the ultimate hope of getting back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
their Flos and Lucys, although leave, for them, was
practically non-existent? What had they to look
forward to but endless work in filth and danger, heaving
guns, grooming horses, cleaning harness eternally?
And yet their obedience and readiness and courage were
limitless, wonderful.</p>

<p>We settled down to training and football and did our
best to acquire the methods of the new army. My
Major, who had been in command of the brigade, had
fallen ill on the march and had been sent to England.
The doctor was of opinion that he wouldn’t be coming
out again. He was worn out. How characteristic of the
wilfully blind system which insists that square pegs
shall be made to fit round holes! There was a man who
should have been commanding an army, wasted in the
command of a battery, while old men without a millionth
part of his personality, magnetism or knowledge recklessly
flung away lives in the endeavour to justify their positions.
In the Boer War if a General lost three hundred men
there was an inquiry into the circumstances. Now if he
didn’t lose three hundred thousand he was a bad General.
There were very few bad ones apparently!</p>

<p>At least one could thank God that the Major was out
of it with a whole skin, although physically a wreck.</p>

<p>The guns we drew from Ordnance at Poix and Chuignolles
were not calibrated, but there was a range half a
day’s march distant and we were ordered to fire there
in readiness for going back into the line. So one morning
before dawn we set out to find the pin-point given us on
the map. Dawn found us on a road which led through a
worse hell than even Dante visited. Endless desolation
spread away on every side, empty, flat, filled with an
infinite melancholy. No part of the earth’s surface
remained intact. One shell hole merged into another in
an endless pattern of pockmarks, unexploded duds lying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
in hundreds in every direction. Bits of wreckage lay
scattered, shell baskets, vague shapes of iron and metal
which bespoke the one-time presence of man. Here and
there steam rollers, broken and riddled, stuck up like
the bones of camels in the desert. A few wooden crosses
marked the wayside graves, very few. For the most
part the dead had lain where they fell, trodden into the
earth. Everywhere one almost saw a hand sticking up,
a foot that had worked up to the surface again. A few
bricks half overgrown marked where once maidens had
been courted by their lovers. The quiet lane ringing with
the songs of birds where they had met in the summer
evenings at the stroke of the Angelus was now one jagged
stump, knee-high, from which the birds had long since
fled. The spirits of a million dead wailed over that ghastly
graveyard, unconsecrated by the priests of God. In
the grey light one could nearly see the corpses sit up in their
countless hundreds at the noise of the horses’ feet, and
point with long fingers, screaming bitter ridicule through
their shapeless gaping jaws. And when at last we found
the range and the guns broke the eerie stillness the echo
in the hills was like bursts of horrible laughter.</p>

<p>And on the edge of all this death was that little sturdy
boy with the golden hair, bubbling with life, who played
with the empty sleeve of his young father spewed out of
the carnage, mutilated, broken in this game of fools.</p>


<h3>21</h3>

<p>February found us far from Chuignolles. Our road
south had taken us through a country of optimism where
filled-in trenches were being cultivated once more by old
women and boys, barbed wire had been gathered in like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
an iron harvest and life was trying to creep back again
like sap up the stem of a bruised flower. Their homes were
made of empty petrol tins, bits of corrugated iron, the
wreckage of the battlefield,&mdash;these strange persistent old
people, clinging desperately to their clod of earth, bent
by the storm but far from being broken, ploughing round
the lonely graves of the unknown dead, sparing a moment
to drop a bunch of green stuff on them. Perhaps some
one was doing the same to their son’s grave.</p>

<p>We came to Jussy and Flavy-le-Martel, an undulating
country of once-wooded hillsides now stamped under the
Hun’s heel and where even then the spiteful long-range
shell came raking in the neatly swept muck heaps that
once had been villages. The French were there, those
blue-clad, unshaven poilus who, having seen their land
laid waste, turned their eyes steadily towards Germany
with the gleam of faith in them that moves mountains,
officered by men who called them “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mes enfants</i>” and
addressed each one as “thou.”</p>

<p>We had reached the southern end of the British line
and were to take over the extra bit down to Barisis. Our
own zone was between Essigny and Benay and in a
morning of thick fog the Divisional Battery Commanders
and ourselves went up to the gun positions held by the
slim French 75’s. They welcomed us politely, bowing us
into scratches in the earth and offering sausages and red
wine and cigarettes of Caporal. It appeared that peace
reigned on that front. Not a shell fell, hardly was a
round ever fired. Then followed maps and technical
details of pin-points and zero lines and O.P.’s and the
colour of S.O.S. rockets. We visited the guns and
watched them fire a round or two and discussed the
differences between them and our eighteen-pounders
and at last after much shaking of hands bade them
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</span> and left them in the fog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>The relief took place under cover of night without a
hitch, in a silence unbroken by any gun, and finally,
after having journeyed to the O.P. with the French
Battery Commander, up to our thighs in mud, fired on
the zero point to check the line, reported ourselves ready
to take on an S.O.S. and watched the French officer disappear
in the direction of his wagon line, we found ourselves
masters of the position.</p>

<p>The fog did eventually lift, revealing the least hopeful
of any gun positions it has ever been my lot to occupy.
The whole country was green, a sort of turf. In this were
three great white gashes of upturned chalk visible to the
meanest intelligence as being the three battery positions.
True, they were under the crest from any Hun O.P., but
that didn’t minimize the absurdity. There were such
things as balloons and aeroplanes. Further inspection
revealed shell holes neatly bracketing the guns, not many,
but quite sufficient to prove that Fritz had done his job
well. Beside each gun pit was a good deep dugout for
the detachment and we had sleeping quarters that would
stop at least a four-two. The mess was a quaint little
hut of hooped iron above ground, camouflaged with
chalky earth, big enough to hold a table and four officers,
if arranged carefully. We rigged up shelves and hung
new fighting maps and Kirchners and got the stove to
burn and declared ourselves ready for the war again.
We spent long mornings exploring the trenches, calling
on a rather peevish infantry whose manners left much to
be desired, and found that as usual the enemy had all
the observation on the opposite ridge. Behind the
trench system we came upon old gun positions shelled out
of all recognition, and looked back over an empty countryside
with rather a gloomy eye. It was distinctly unprepossessing.
If there were ever a show&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So we played the gramophone by night and invented a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
knife-throwing game in the door of the hut and waited
for whatever Fate might have in store for us. The
Captain had gone on leave from Chuignolles. The night
after his return he came up to the guns as my own leave
was due again. So having initiated him into the defence
scheme and the S.O.S. rules I packed up my traps and
departed,&mdash;as it turned out for good.</p>

<p>Fate decreed that my fighting was to be done with the
battery which I had helped to make and whose dead I
had buried.</p>

<p>On my return from leave fourteen days later, towards
the end of February, I was posted back to them. The
end of February,&mdash;a curious period of mental tightening
up, of expectation of some colossal push received with a
certain incredulity. He’d push all right, but not here.
And yet, in the depths of one’s being, there formed a
vague apprehension that made one restless and took the
taste out of everything. The work seemed unsatisfactory
in the new battle positions to which we were moved, a
side-step north, seven thousand yards from the front line,
just behind Essigny which peeped over a million trenches
to St. Quentin. The men didn’t seem to have their
hearts in it and one found fault in everything. The new
mess, a wooden hut under trees on a hilltop with a deep
dugout in it, was very nice, allowing us to bask in the
sun whenever it shone and giving a wonderful view over
the whole zone, but seemed to lack privacy. One
yearned to be alone sometimes and always there was some
one there. The subalterns were practically new to me,
and although one laughed and talked one couldn’t settle
down as in the old days with the Major and Pip Don.
The Scots Captain was also occupying the hilltop. It
was good to go off on long reconnaissances with him and
argue violently on all the known philosophies and literatures,
to challenge him to revolver shooting competitions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
and try and escape the eternal obsession that clouded one’s
brain, an uneasiness that one couldn’t place, like the
feeling that makes one cold in the pit of the stomach
before going down to get ready for a boxing competition,
magnified a million times.</p>

<p>The weather was warm and sunny after misty dawns
and the whole country was white with floating cobwebs.
The last touches were being put to the gun position and a
narrow deep trench ran behind the guns which were a
quarter of a mile beyond the hilltop, down beyond the
railway line under camouflage in the open. Word came
round that “The Attack,” was for this day, then that,
then the other, and the heavy guns behind us made the
night tremble with their counter-preparation work,
until at last one said, “Please God, they’ll get on with it,
and let’s get it over!” The constant cry of “Wolf!
Wolf!” was trying.</p>

<p>Everybody knew about it and all arrangements were
made, extra ammunition, and extra gunners at the positions,
details notified as to manning O.P.’s, the probable
time at which we should have to open fire being given as
ten o’clock at night at extreme range.</p>

<p>My Captain, a bloodthirsty Canadian, had gone on
leave to the south of France, which meant leaving a
subaltern in the wagon line while I had three with me.</p>

<p>The days became an endless tension, the nights a
jumpy stretch of darkness, listening for the unknown.
Matters were not helped by my brother’s rolling up one
day and giving out the date definitely as the twenty-first.
It was on the ninth that he arrived and took me for a joy-ride
to Barisis to have a look at the Hun in the Forêt de
St. Gobain, so deeply wooded that the car could run to
within a hundred yards of the front-line trench. We
dined at the charming old town of Noyon on the way
back and bought English books in a shop there, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
stayed the night in a little inn just off the market square.
The next morning he dropped me at the battery and I
watched him roll away in the car, feeling an accentuated
loneliness, a yearning to go with him and get out of the
damned firing line, to escape the responsibility that rode
one like an Old Man from the Sea.</p>

<p>In war there is only one escape.</p>

<p>The nights of the eighteenth and nineteenth were a
continuous roll of heavy guns, lasting till just before the
dawn, the days comparatively quiet. Raids had taken
place all along the front on both sides and identifications
made which admitted of no argument.</p>

<p>On the night of the twentieth we turned in as usual
about midnight with the blackness punctuated by flashes
and the deep-voiced rumble of big guns a sort of comfort
in the background. If Brother Fritz was massing anywhere
for the attack at least he was having an unpleasant
time. We were unable to join in because we were in
battle positions seven thousand yards behind the front
line. The other eighteen-pounders in front of us were
busy, however, and if the show didn’t come off we were
going up to relieve them in a week’s time. So we played
our goodnight tune on the gramophone, the junior
subaltern waiting in his pyjamas while the last notes were
sung. Then he flicked out the light and hopped into bed,
and presently the hut was filled by his ungentle snores.
Then one rang through a final message to the signaller
on duty at the guns and closed one’s eyes.</p>


<h3>22</h3>

<p>The twenty-first of March, 1918, has passed into
history now, a page of disaster, blood and prisoners, a
turning point in the biggest war in history, a day which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
broke more hearts than any other day in the whole four
and a half years; and yet to some of us it brought an
infinite relief. The tension was released. The fight
was on to the death.</p>

<p>We were jerked awake in the darkness by a noise
which beat upon the brain, made the hill tremble and
shiver, which seemed to fill the world and all time with
its awful threat.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch,&mdash;4 a.m.</p>

<p>The subaltern who lay on the bed beside mine said,
“She’s off!” and lit a candle with a laugh. He was dead
within six hours. We put coats over our pyjamas and
went out of the hut. Through the fog there seemed to
be a sort of glow along the whole front right and left,
like one continuous gun flash. The Scots Captain came
round with his subalterns and joined us, and two “Archie”
gunners who shared a tent under the trees and messed
with us. We stood in a group, talking loudly to make
ourselves heard. There was nothing to be done but to
stand by. According to plan we should not come into
action until about 10 p.m. that night to cover the retreat,
if necessary, of the gunners and infantry in the line. Our
range to start with would be six thousand yards.</p>

<p>So we dressed and talked to Brigade, who had no information.
At six o’clock Brigade issued an order,
“Man O.P.’s at once.” The fog still hung like a blanket,
and no news had come through from the front line. The
barrage was reported thick in front of and in Essigny with
gas.</p>

<p>The signallers were ready, three of them. The subaltern
detailed had only to fill his pockets with food.</p>

<p>The subaltern detailed! It sounds easy, doesn’t
it? But it isn’t any fun detailing a man to go out into
a gas barrage in any sort of a show, and this was bigger
than the wildest imagination could conceive. I won<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>dered,
while giving him instructions, whether I should
ever see him again. I never did. He was taken prisoner,
and the signallers too.</p>

<p>They went out into the fog while the servants lit the
fire and bustled about, getting us an early breakfast.
The Anti-Aircraft discussed the advisability of withdrawing
immediately or waiting to see what the barrage would
do. They waited till about 9 a.m. and then got out.
The Scots Captain and I wished them luck and looked at
each other silently and refilled pipes.</p>

<p>There was a hint of sun behind the fog now, but
visibility only carried about two hundred yards. The
Guns reported that the barrage was coming towards
them. The Orderly Officer had been down and found
all things in readiness for any emergency. None of the
O.P.’s answered. Somewhere in that mist they were
dodging the barrage while we sat and waited, an eye on
the weather, an eye on the time, an ear always for the
buzz of the telephone; box respirators in the alert position,
the guns laid on the S.O.S. loaded with H.E.</p>

<p>Does one think in times like that? I don’t know.
Only little details stand out in the brain like odd features
revealed in a flash of lightning during a storm. I remember
putting a drawing-pin into the corner of a
Kirchner picture and seeing the headlines of the next
day’s paper at home; I saw the faces of my people as
they read them. I saw them just coming down to
breakfast at the precise moment that I was sticking in
the drawing-pin, the door open on to the lawn&mdash;in
America, still asleep, as they were six hours behind, or
possibly only just turning in after a dance&mdash;in Etaples,
where perhaps the noise had already reached one of them.
When would they hear from me again? They would be
worrying horribly.</p>

<p>The ’phone buzzed. “Brigade, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>“Right. Yes?&mdash;S.O.S. 3000! <em>Three</em> thousand?&mdash;Right!
Battery! Drop to <em>three</em> thousand, S.O.S.&mdash;Three
rounds per gun per minute till I come down.”</p>

<p>It was 10 a.m. and that was the range, when according
to plan it shouldn’t have come till 10 p.m. at double the
range.</p>

<p>The subalterns were already out, running down to the
guns as I snatched the map and followed after, to hear
the battery open fire as I left the hut.</p>

<p>The greater significance of this S.O.S. came to me before
I’d left the hut. At that range our shells would fall
just the other side of Essigny, still a vague blur in the
mist. What had happened to the infantry three thousand
yards beyond? What had become of the gunners?
There were no signs of our people coming back. The
country, as far as one could see in the fog, was empty save
for the bursting shells which were spread about between
Essigny and the railway, with the battery in the barrage.
The noise was still so universal that it was impossible to
know if any of our guns farther forward were still in action.
They couldn’t be if we were firing. It meant&mdash;God knew
what it meant!</p>

<p>The subalterns went on to the guns while I stopped in
the control dug into the side of the railway and shed my
coat, sweating after the quarter-mile run. Five-nines
and pip-squeaks were bursting on the railway and it
seemed as if they had the battery taped.</p>

<p>To get off my coat was a matter of less than half a
minute. It had only just dropped to the ground when
the signaller held me the instrument. “Will you speak
here, sir?”</p>

<p>I took it.</p>

<p>“Is that the Major?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Will you come, sir? Mr. B.’s badly wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Sergeant &mdash;&mdash; has lost an eye and there’s no one here
to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go on firing. I’m coming over.” Badly wounded?</p>

<p>I leaped up out of the dugout and ran. There was
no shell with my name on it that morning. The ground
went up a yard away from me half a dozen times but I
reached the guns and dived under the camouflage into
the trench almost on top of poor old B. who was lying
motionless, one arm almost smashed off, blood everywhere.
It was he who had said “She’s off!” and lit the candle
with a laugh. A man was endeavouring to tie him up.
Behind him knelt a sergeant with his face in his hands.
As I jumped down into the trench he raised it. “I’m
blind, sir,” he said. His right eye was shot away.</p>

<p>The others were all right. I went from gun to gun and
found them firing steadily.</p>

<p>Somehow or other we tied up the subaltern and carried
him along the narrow trench. Mercifully he was unconscious.
We got him out at last on to a stretcher.
Four men went away with it, the sergeant stumbling
after. The subaltern was dead before they reached a
dressing station. He left a wife and child.</p>

<p>There were only the junior subaltern and myself left
to fight the battery. He was twenty last birthday and
young at that. If I stopped anything there was only that
boy between King and country and the Hun. Is <em>any</em>
reward big enough for these babes of ours?</p>

<p>Perhaps God will give it. King and country won’t.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Vague forms of moving groups of men could be seen
through my glasses in the neighbourhood of Essigny
impossible to say whether British or German. The sun
was struggling to pierce the mist. The distance was about
a thousand yards. We were still firing on the S.O.S.
range, as ordered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>I became aware of a strange subaltern grinning up at
me out of the trench.</p>

<p>“Where the devil do you spring from?” said I.</p>

<p>He climbed out and joined me on the top, hatless,
minus box respirator, cheery. Another babe.</p>

<p>“I’m from the six-inch section straight in front, sir,”
he said. “They’ve captured my guns. Do you think
you could take ’em on?”</p>

<p>They <em>were</em> Germans, then, those moving forms!</p>

<p>I swept the glasses round once more anxiously. There
were six, seven, ten, creeping up the railway embankment
on the left flank <em>behind</em> the battery. Where the hell
were our infantry reinforcements? My Babe sent the
news back to Brigade while I got a gun on top and fired
at the six-inch battery in front over open sights at a
thousand yards with fuse 4. The Hun was there all right.
He ran at the third round. Then we switched and took
on individual groups as they appeared.</p>

<p>The party on the railway worried me. It was improper
to have the enemy behind one’s battery. So I got on the
’phone to the Scots Captain and explained the position.
It looked as if the Hun had established himself with
machine guns in the signal box. The skipper took it
on over open sights with H.E. At the fourth round there
was only a settling mass of red brick dust. I felt easier
in my mind and continued sniping groups of two or three
with an added zest and most satisfactory results. The
Hun didn’t seem to want to advance beyond Essigny.
He hung about the outskirts and, when he showed,
ran, crouching low. From his appearance it looked
as if he had come to stay. Each of them had a complete
pack strapped on to his back with a new pair of boots
attached. The rest of the battery dropped their range
and searched and swept from the pits. The Skipper
joined in the sniping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>A half platoon of infantry came marching at a snail’s
pace along the railway behind me,&mdash;on the top of course,
in full view! I wanted to make sure of those Huns on
the embankment, so I whistled to the infantry officer and
began semaphoring, a method of signalling at which I
rather fancied myself.</p>

<p>It seemed to frighten that infantry lad. At the first
waggle he stopped his men and turned them about. In
twenty leaps I covered the hundred yards or so between
us, screaming curses, and brought him to a halt. He
wore glasses and looked like a sucking curate. He may
have been in private life but I gave tongue at high
pressure, regardless of his feelings, and it was a very red-faced
platoon that presently doubled along the other side
of the railway under cover towards the embankment,
thirsting for blood, mine for choice, Fritz’s from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embarras
de richesse</i>.</p>

<p>I returned to my sniping, feeling distinctly better,
as the little groups were no longer advancing but going
back,&mdash;and there was that ferocious platoon chivvying
them in the rear!</p>

<p>Things might have been much worse.</p>

<p>A megaphone’s all right, but scream down it for three
hours and see what happens to your voice. Mine
sounded much like a key in a rusty lock. Hunger too
was no longer to be denied about three o’clock in the
afternoon after breakfast at cock-crow. The six-inch
subaltern had tried unsuccessfully to get back to his
guns. The Hun, however, had established a machine-gun
well the other side of them and approach single-handed
was useless. Lord knew where his gunners were!
Prisoners, probably. So he returned and asked if I had
any use for him. Stout lads of his kidney are not met
with every day. So I sent him up the hill to get food and
a box respirator. He returned, grinning more cheerily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
than before, so I left him and the Babe to fight the good
fight and went to get a fresh point of view from the tree
O.P. up the hill. They seemed to be doing useful work
between them by the time I got up the tree, so I left them
to it and went to the mess to get some food.</p>

<p>It seemed curiously empty. Kits, half-packed, lay
about the floor. The breakfast plates, dirty, were still
on the table. I called each servant by name. No
answer.</p>

<p>The other battery’s servants were round the corner.
I interviewed them. They had seen nothing of my
people for hours. They thought that they had gone
down to the wagon line. In other words it meant that
while we were stopping the Hun, with poor old B. killed
and the sergeant with an eye blown out, those dirty
servants had run away!</p>

<p>It came over me with something of a shock that if I
put them under arrest the inevitable sentence was
death.</p>

<p>I had already sent one officer and three men to their
death, or worse, at the O.P. and seen another killed at
the guns. Now these four! Who would be a Battery
Commander?</p>

<p>However, food was the immediate requirement. The
other battery helped and I fed largely, eased my raw
throat with pints of water and drank a tot of rum for luck.
Those precious servants had left my even more precious
cigars unpacked. If the Hun was coming I’d see him
elsewhere before he got those smokes. So I lit one and
filled my pockets with the rest, and laden with food and a
flask of rum went back to the guns and fed my subaltern.
The men’s rations had been carried over from the cook
house.</p>

<p>A few more infantry went forward on the right and
started a bit of a counter-attack but there was no weight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
behind it. They did retake Essigny or some parts of it,
but as the light began to fail they came back again, and
the Hun infantry hung about the village without advancing.</p>

<p>With the darkness we received the order to retire to
Flavy as soon as the teams came up. The barrage had
long since dropped to desultory fire on the Hun side,
and as we were running short of ammunition, we only
fired as targets offered. On returning up the hill I found
it strongly held by our infantry, some of whom incidentally
stole my trench coat.</p>

<p>The question of teams became an acute worry as time
went on. The Hun wasn’t too remote and one never
knew what he might be up to in the dark, and our infantry
were no use because the line they held was a quarter of a
mile behind the nearest battery. The skipper and I sent
off men on bicycles to hurry the teams, while the gunners
got the guns out of the pits in the darkness ready to hook
in and move off at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we ate again and smoked and summoned
what patience we could, endeavouring to snatch a sleep.
It wasn’t till ten o’clock that at last we heard wheels,&mdash;the
gun limbers, cooks’ cart and a G.S. wagon came up
with the wagon line officer who had brought the servants
back with him. There was no time to deal with them.
The officer went down to hook in to the guns and I saw to
the secret papers, money, maps and office documents
which are the curse of all batteries. The whole business
of packing up had to be done in pitch darkness, in all the
confusion of the other battery’s vehicles and personnel,
to say nothing of the infantry. We didn’t bother about
the Hun. Silence reigned.</p>

<p>It was not till midnight that the last of the guns was
up and the last of the vehicles packed, and then I heard
the voice of the Babe calling for me. He crashed up on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
a white horse in the darkness and said with a sob,
“Dickie’s wounded!”</p>

<p>“Dickie” was the wagon line subaltern, a second
lieutenant who had got the D.S.O. in the Cambrai show,
one of the stoutest lads God ever made. In my mind I
had been relying on him enormously for the morrow.</p>

<p>“Is he bad? Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Just behind, sir,” said the Babe. “I don’t know how
bad it is.”</p>

<p>Dickie came up on a horse. There was blood down
the horse’s shoulder and he went lame slightly.</p>

<p>“Where is it, Dickie, Old Thing?”</p>

<p>His voice came from between his teeth. “A shrapnel
bullet through the foot,” he said. “I’m damn sorry
Major.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look.” I flashed a torch on it. The
spur was bent into his foot just behind the ankle, broken,
the point sticking in.</p>

<p>There was no doctor, no stretcher, no means of getting
the spur out.</p>

<p>“Can you stick it? The wagon is piled mountains
high. I can’t shove you on that. Do you think you can
hang on till we get down to Flavy?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” he said.</p>

<p>He had a drink of rum and lit a cigarette and the
battery got mounted. I kept him in front with me
and we moved off in the dark, the poor little horse,
wounded also, stumbling now and again. What that boy
must have suffered I don’t know. It was nearly three
hours later before the battery got near its destination
and all that time he remained in the saddle, lighting
one cigarette from another and telling me he was “damn
sorry.” I expected him to faint every moment and stood
by to grab him as he fell.</p>

<p>At last we came to a crossroads at which the battery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
had to turn off to reach the rendezvous. There was a
large casualty clearing station about half a mile on.</p>

<p>So I left the battery in charge of the Babe and took
Dickie straight on, praying for a sight of lights.</p>

<p>The place was in utter darkness when we reached it,
the hut doors yawning open, everything empty. They
had cleared out!</p>

<p>Then round a corner I heard a motor lorry starting
up. They told me they were going to Ham. There was
a hospital there.</p>

<p>So Dickie slid off his horse and was lifted into the lorry.</p>

<p>As my trench coat had been stolen by one of the
infantry he insisted that I should take his British warm,
as within an hour he would be between blankets in a
hospital.</p>

<p>I accepted his offer gladly,&mdash;little knowing that I was
not to take it off again for another nine days or so!</p>

<p>Dickie went off and I mounted my horse again, cursing
the war and everything to do with it, and led his horse,
dead lame now, in search of the battery. It took me an
hour to find them, parked in a field, the gunners rolled
up in blankets under the wagons.</p>

<p>The 21st of March was over. The battery had lost
three subalterns, a sergeant, three signallers and a
gunner.</p>

<p>France lost her temper with England.</p>

<p>Germany, if she only knew it, had lost the war.</p>


<h3>23</h3>

<p>The new line of defence was to be the canal at Flavy.</p>

<p>After two hours’ sleep in boots, spurs and Dickie’s
coat, a servant called me with tea and bacon. Washing
or shaving was out of the question. The horses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
were waiting&mdash;poor brutes, how they were worked those
days&mdash;and the Quartermaster-sergeant and I got mounted
and rode away into the unknown dark, flickering a torch
from time to time on to the map and finding our way by it.</p>

<p>With the Captain on leave, one subaltern dead, another
left behind in Germany, a third wounded, one good sergeant
and my corporal signaller away on a course, it
didn’t look like a very hopeful start for fighting an indefinite
rearguard action.</p>

<p>I was left with the Babe, keen but not very knowledgeable,
and one other subaltern who became a stand-by.
They two were coming with me and the guns; the
sergeant-major would be left with the wagon line. Furthermore
I had absolutely no voice and couldn’t speak
above a whisper.</p>

<p>Of what had happened on the flanks of our army and
along the whole front, there was absolutely no news.
The Divisional infantry and gunners were mostly killed
or captured in the mist. We never saw anything of them
again but heard amazing tales of German officers walking
into the backs of batteries in the fog and saying, “Will
you cease fire, please? You are my prisoners,” as polite
as you please.</p>

<p>What infantry were holding the canal, I don’t know,&mdash;presumably
those who had held our hilltop overnight.
All we knew was that our immediate job was to meet the
Colonel in Flavy and get a position in the Riez de Cugny
just behind and pump shells into the Germans as they
advanced on the canal. The Babe and the Stand-by
were to bring the battery to a given rendezvous. Meanwhile
the Colonel and all of us foregathered in a wrecked
cottage in Flavy and studied maps while the Colonel
swallowed a hasty cup of tea. He was ill and a few hours
later was sent back in an ambulance.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock we had found positions and the guns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
were coming in. Camouflage was elementary. Gun
platforms were made from the nearest cottage wall or
barn doors. Ammunition was dumped beside the gun
wheels.</p>

<p>While that was being done I climbed trees for an O.P.,
finding one eventually in a farm on a hill, but the mist hid
everything. The Huns seemed to get their guns up as if
by magic and already shells were smashing what remained
of Flavy. It was impossible to shoot the guns in properly.
The bursts couldn’t be seen so the line was checked and
rechecked with compass and director, and we opened fire
on targets ordered by Brigade, shooting off the map.</p>

<p>Riez de Cugny was a collection of cottages with a street
running through and woods and fields all around and
behind. The inhabitants had fled in what they stood up
in. We found a chicken clucking hungrily in a coop and
had it for dinner that night. We installed ourselves in a
cottage and made new fighting maps, the Scots Captain and
I&mdash;his battery was shooting not a hundred yards from
mine&mdash;and had the stove lit with anything burnable that
came handy, old chairs, meat rolling boards, boxes,
drawers and shelves.</p>

<p>It seemed that the attack on the canal was more or less
half-hearted. The bridges had been blown up by our
sappers and the machine gunners made it too hot for the
Hun. Meanwhile we had the gun limbers hidden near
the guns, the teams harnessed. The wagon line itself
was a couple of miles away, endeavouring to collect rations,
forage and ammunition. The sergeant-major was a
wonder. During the whole show he functioned alone and
never at any time did he fail to come up to the scratch.</p>

<p>Even when I lost the wagon line for two days I knew
that he was all right and would bring them through safely.
Meanwhile aeroplanes soared over and drew smoke trails
above the battery and after a significant pause five-nines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
began searching the fields for us. Our own planes didn’t
seem to exist and the Hun explored at will. On the whole
things seemed pretty quiet. Communication was maintained
all the time with Brigade; we were quietly getting
rid of a lot of ammunition on targets indicated by the
infantry and the five-nines weren’t near enough to worry
about. So the Scot and I went off in the afternoon and
reconnoitred a way back by a cross-country trail to the
wagon line,&mdash;a curious walk that, across sunny fields
where birds darted in and out of hedges in utter disregard
of nations which were stamping each other into the
earth only a few hedges away. Tiny buds were on the
trees, tingling in the warmth of the early sun. All nature
was beginning the new year of life while we fools in our
blind rage and folly dealt open-handedly with death,
heeding not the promise of spring in our veins, with its
colour and tenderness and infinite hope.</p>

<p>Just a brief pause it was, like a fleecy cloud disappearing
from view, and then we were in the wagon lines,
soldiers again, in a tight position, with detail trickling
from our lips, and orders and arrangements. Dickie was
well on his way to England now, lucky Dickie! And yet
there was a fascination about it, an exhilaration that made
one “fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds’
worth of distance run.” It was the real thing this, red
war in a moving battle, and it took all one’s brain to
compete with it. I wouldn’t have changed places with
Dickie. A “Blighty” wound was the last thing that
seemed desirable. Let us see the show through to the
bitter end.</p>

<p>We got back to the guns and the cottage and in front
of us Flavy was a perfect hell. Fires in all directions and
shells spreading all round and over the area. Our wagons
returned, having snatched ammunition from blazing
dumps, like a new version of snapdragon, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
falling darkness the sky flared up and down fitfully. That
night we dished out rum all round to the gunners and
turned half of them in to sleep beside the guns while the
other half fought. Have you ever considered sleeping
beside a firing eighteen-pounder? It’s easy&mdash;when
you’ve fought it and carried shells for forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>We had dinner off that neglected fowl, both batteries
in the cottage, and made absurd remarks about the
photos left on the mantelpiece and fell asleep, laughing,
on our chairs or two of us on a bed, booted and spurred
still, taking turns to wake and dash out and fire a target,
called by the liaison officer down there with the infantry,
while the others never moved when the salvos rocked
the cottage to its foundations, or five-nines dropped in
the garden and splashed it into the street.</p>

<p>The Hun hadn’t crossed the canal. That was what
mattered. The breakfast was very nearly cooked next
morning about seven and we were shooting gun fire
and salvos when the order came over the ’phone to retire
immediately and rendezvous on the Villeselve-Beaumont
crossroads. Fritz was over the canal in the fog.
The Babe dashed round to warn the teams to hook in.
They had been in cottages about two hundred yards from
the guns, the horses harnessed but on a line, the drivers
sleeping with them. The Stand-by doubled over to the
guns and speeded up the rate of fire. No good leaving
ammunition behind. The signallers disconnected telephones
and packed them on gun limbers. Both gunners
and drivers had breakfasted. We ate ours half cooked
in our fingers while they were packing up.</p>

<p>The mist was like a wet blanket. At twenty yards
objects lost their shape and within about twenty minutes
of receiving the order the battery was ready. We had
the other battery licked by five good minutes and pulled
out of the field on to the road at a good walk. In the fog<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
the whole country looked different. Direction was
impossible. One prayed that one wasn’t marching
towards Germany&mdash;and went on. At last I recognised
the cross-country track with a sigh of relief. It was
stiff going for the horses, but they did it and cut off a
mile of road echoing with shouts and traffic in confusion,
coming out eventually on an empty main road. We
thought we were well ahead but all the wagon lines were
well in front of us. We caught up their tail-ends just
as we reached Beaumont, which was blocked with every
kind of infantry, artillery and R.A.M.C. transport, mules,
horses and motors. However there was a Headquarters
in Beaumont with Generals buzzing about and signallers,
so I told the Stand-by to take the battery along with
the traffic to the crossroads and wait for me.</p>

<p>Our own General was in that room. I cleaved a
passage to him and asked for orders. He told me that
it was reported that the Hun was in Ham&mdash;right round
our left flank. I was, therefore, to get into position at
the crossroads and “Cover Ham.”</p>

<p>“Am I to open fire, sir?”</p>

<p>“No. Not till you see the enemy.”</p>

<p>I’d had enough of “seeing the enemy” on the first
day. It seemed to me that if the Hun was in Ham
the whole of our little world was bound to be captured.
There wasn’t any time to throw away, so I leaped on to
my horse and cantered after the battery followed by the
groom. At the crossroads the block was double and
treble while an officer yelled disentangling orders and
pushed horses in the nose.</p>

<p>The map showed Ham to be due north of the crossroads.
There proved to be an open field, turfed just
off the road with a dozen young trees planted at intervals.
What lay between them and Ham it was impossible to
guess. The map looked all right. So I claimed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
traffic officer’s attention, explained that a battery of
guns was coming into action just the other side and
somehow squeezed through, while the other vehicles
waited. We dropped into action under the trees. The
teams scattered about a hundred yards to a flank and we
laid the line due north.</p>

<p>At that moment a Staff subaltern came up at the
canter. “The General says that the Hun is pretty
near, sir. Will you send out an officer’s patrol?”</p>

<p>He disappeared again, while I collected the Stand-by,
a man of considerable stomach.</p>

<p>The orders were simply, “Get hold of servants, cooks,
spare signallers and clerks. Arm them with rifles and
go off straight into the fog. Spread out and if you meet
a Hun fire a salvo and double back immediately to a
flank.”</p>

<p>While that was being done the Babe went round
and had a dozen shells set at fuse 4 at each gun. It
gives a lovely burst at a thousand yards. The Stand-by
and his little army went silently forth. The corner
house seemed to indicate an O.P. I took a signaller
with me and we climbed upstairs into the roof, knocked
a hole in the tiles and installed a telephone which eventually
connected with Brigade.</p>

<p>I began to get the fidgets about the Stand-by. This
cursed fog was too much of a good thing. It looked as
if the God the Huns talked so much about was distinctly
on their side. However, after an agonising wait, with an
ear strained for the salvo of rifle fire, the fog rolled up.
Like dots in the distant fields I saw the Stand-by with
two rows of infantry farther on. The Stand-by saw them
too and turned about. More than that, through glasses
I could see troops and horse transports advancing quickly
over the skyline in every direction. Columns of them,
Germans, far out of range of an eighteen-pounder. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
near as I could I located them on the map and worried
Brigade for the next hour with pin-points.</p>

<p>Ham lay straight in front of my guns. The Germans
were still shelling it and several waves of our own infantry
were lying in position in series waiting for their
infantry to emerge round the town. It was good to see
our men out there, although the line looked dangerously
bulgy.</p>

<p>After a bit I climbed down from the roof. The road
had cleared of traffic and there was a subaltern of the
Scot’s battery at the corner with the neck of a bottle
of champagne sticking out of his pocket. A thoughtful
fellow.</p>

<p>So was I! A little later one of the Brigade Headquarters
officers came staggering along on a horse, done
to the world, staying in the saddle more by the grace
of God than his own efforts. Poor old thing, he was
all in, mentally and physically. We talked for a while
but that didn’t improve matters and then I remembered
that bottle of fizz. In the name of humanity and necessity
I commandeered it from the reluctant subaltern and
handed it up to the man in the saddle. Most of it went
down his unshaven chin and inside his collar, but it did
the trick all right.</p>

<p>What was left was mine by right of conquest, and
I lapped it down, a good half bottle of it. There were
dry biscuits forthcoming too, just as if one were in town,
and I was able to cap it with a fat cigar. Happy days!</p>

<p>Then the Scot arrived upon his stout little mare followed
by his battery, which came into position on the
same crossroads a hundred yards away, shooting at right
angles to me, due east, back into Cugny from where we
had come. Infantry were going up, rumours of cavalry
were about and the bloodstained Tommies who came back
were not very numerous. There seemed to be a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
of batteries tucked away behind all the hedges and things
looked much more hopeful. Apart from giving pin-points
of the far distant enemy there was nothing to be
done except talk to all and sundry and try and get news.
Some French machine-gunner officers appeared who told
us that the entire French army was moving by forced
marches to assist in stopping the advance and were due
to arrive about six o’clock that night. They were late.</p>

<p>Then too, we found that the cellar of the O.P. house
was stored with apples. There weren’t many left by
the time the two batteries had helped themselves. As
many horses as the farmyard would hold were cleared
off the position and put under cover. The remainder
and the guns were forced to remain slap in the open.
It was bad luck because the Hun sent out about a dozen
low-flying machines that morning and instead of going
over Ham, which would have been far more interesting
for them, they spotted us and opened with machine
guns.</p>

<p>The feeling of helplessness with a dozen great roaring
machines spitting at you just overhead is perfectly exasperating.
You can’t cock an eighteen-pounder up like
an Archie and have a bang at them, and usually, as
happened then, your own machine gun jams. It was
a comic twenty minutes but trying for the nerves. The
gunners dived under the gun shields and fired rifles
through the wheels. The drivers stood very close to the
horses and hoped for the best. The signallers struggled
with the machine gun, uttering a stream of blasphemies.
And all the time the Hun circled and emptied drum
after drum from a height of about a hundred feet. I
joined in the barrage with my revolver.</p>

<p>Two horses went down with a crash and a scream.
A man toppled over in the road. Bullets spat on the
ground like little puffs of smoke. Two went through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
my map, spread out at my feet, and at last away they
roared,&mdash;presumably under the impression that they
had put us out of action. The horses were dead!</p>

<p>The man was my servant, who had run away on the
first morning. Three through his left leg. Better
than being shot at dawn, anyhow.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the mess cook had already become
a casualty. He was another of the faint-hearted and
had fallen under a wagon in the fog and been run over.
A rib or two went. Poetic justice was rampant that
morning. It left me two to deal with. I decided to let
it go for the time and see if fate would relieve me of the
job. As a matter of fact it didn’t, and many many
lifetimes later, when we were out of action, I had the
two of them up in a room with a ceiling and a cloth on
the table, and the Babe stood at my elbow as a witness.</p>

<p>One was a man of about thirty-eight or forty, a long-nosed,
lazy, unintelligent blighter. The other was a
short, scrubby, Dago-looking, bullet-headed person,&mdash;poor
devils, both cannon fodder. My face may have
looked like a bit of rock but I was immensely sorry for
them. Given a moment of awful panic, what kind of
intelligence could they summon to fight it, what sort
of breeding and heredity was at the back of them?
None. You might as well shoot two horses for stampeding
at a bursting shell. They were gripped by blind
fear and ran for it. They didn’t want to. It was not
a reasoned thing. It was a momentary lack of control.</p>

<p>But to shoot them for it was absurd, a ridiculous
parody of justice. Supposing I had lost my nerve and
cleared out? The chances are that being a senior officer
I should have been sent down to the base as R.T.O.
or M.L.O. and after a few months received the D.S.O.
It has been done. They, as Tommies, had only earned
the right to a firing party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>It seemed to me, therefore, that my job was to prevent
any recurrence, so in order to uproot the fear of death
I implanted the fear of God in them both. Sweat and
tears ran down their faces at the end of the interview,&mdash;and
I made the Dago my servant forthwith.</p>

<p>He has redeemed himself many times under worse
shell fire than that barrage of the 21st of March.</p>


<h3>24</h3>

<p>Headquarters gave me another subaltern during
the day. He had been with the battery in the early
days at Armentières but for various reasons had drifted
to another unit.</p>

<p>He joined us just before the order was received to
take up another position farther back and lay out a line
on the Riez de Cugny. The enemy was apparently
coming on. So we hooked in once more about 4.30 in
the afternoon and trekked up the road on to a ridge
behind which was the village of Villeselve. The Hun
seemed to have taken a dislike to it. Five-nines went
winging over our heads as we came into action and bumped
into the village about two hundred yards behind. The
Babe rode back to Brigade to report and ask for orders.
There were no means of knowing where our infantry were
except through Brigade who were at infantry headquarters,
and obviously one couldn’t shoot blind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Dago servant collected bread and
bully and a Tommy’s water bottle, which stank of rum
but contained only water, and the Stand-by, the new
lad and myself sat under a tree watching the Hun barrage
splash in all directions and made a meal.</p>

<p>The Babe didn’t return as soon as he ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
done. With all that shooting going on I was a little
uneasy. So the new lad was told to go to Brigade and
collect both the orders and the Babe.</p>

<p>It was getting dark when the Scot brought up his
battery and wheeled them to drop into action beside us.
As he was doing so the Babe and the new lad returned
together. Their news was uncomforting. Brigade Headquarters
had retired into the blue, and the other two
batteries which had been on the road had also gone.
There was no one there at all.</p>

<p>So the Scotsman and I held a council of war, while
the Stand-by went off on a horse to reconnoitre a passable
way round the shelled village. The light had gone and
the sky behind us was a red glare. The village was
ablaze and at the back of it on the next ridge some
aeroplane hangars were like a beacon to guide storm-tossed
mariners. The crackling could be heard for
miles.</p>

<p>There was no one to give us the line or a target, no
means of finding where the headquarters were or any
likelihood of their finding us as we hadn’t been able to
report our position. We were useless.</p>

<p>At the back of my brain was the word Guivry. I
had heard the Adjutant mention it as a rendezvous.
On the map it seemed miles away, but there was always
the chance of meeting some one on the way who would
know. So while the other people snatched a mouthful
of ration biscuit we brought the teams up and hooked
in.</p>

<p>The Scotsman led as his battery was nearest the
track that the Stand-by reported passable. The only
light was from the burning hangars and we ran into mud
that was axle deep. Incidentally we ran into the barrage.
A subaltern of the other battery was blown off his feet
and deposited in a sitting position in a mud hole. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
was fished out, spluttering oaths, and both batteries
went off at a trot that would have made an inspecting
General scream unintelligible things in Hindustani.
Mercifully they don’t inspect when one is trying to hurry
out of a barrage, so we let it rip up the slope until we had
got past the hangars in whose glow we showed up most
uncomfortably on the top of the ridge. As soon as we
had got into darkness again we halted and took stock
of ourselves. No one was hurt or missing, but all the
dismounted men were puffing and using their sleeves
to wipe the sweat off their faces. I was one.</p>

<p>It was from this point that the second phase of the
retreat began. It was like nothing so much as being
in that half dead condition on the operating table when
the fumes of ether fill one’s brain with phantasies and
flapping birds and wild flights of imagination just before
one loses consciousness, knowing at the time that one
hasn’t quite “gone.” Overfatigue, strain, lack of food
and above all was a craving to stop everything, lie down,
and sleep and sleep and sleep. One’s eyes were glued
open and burnt in the back of one’s head, the skin of
one’s face and hands tightened and stretched, one’s feet
were long since past shape and feeling; wherever the
clothes touched one’s body they irritated&mdash;not that
one could realize each individual ache then. The effect
was one ceaseless dolour from which the brain flung
out and away into the no man’s land of semi-consciousness,
full of thunder and vast fires, only to swing back
at intervals to find the body marching, marching, endlessly,
staggering almost drunkenly, along the interminable
roads of France in the rain and cold. Hour after
hour one rode side by side with the Scot, silent, swaying
in the saddle, staring hollow-eyed into the dark ahead,
or sliding with a stiff crash to the ground and blundering
blindly from rut to rut, every muscle bruised and torn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
Unconsciously every hour one gave a ten-minute halt.
The horses stood drooping, the men lay down on the
side of the road, motionless bundles like the dead, or
sprawled over the vehicles, limp and exhausted, not
smoking, not talking, content to remain inert until the
next word of command should set them in motion again;
wonderful in their recognition of authority, their instant
unquestioning obedience, their power of summoning
back all their faculties for just one more effort, and then
another after that.</p>

<p>The country was unknown. Torches had given out
their last flicker. Road junctions were unmarked.
We struck matches and wrestled with maps that refused
to fold in the right place, and every time Guivry seemed
a million miles away. The noise of shelling dropped
gradually behind until it became a mere soothing lullaby
like the breaking of waves upon a pebble beach while
we rolled with crunching wheels down the long incline
into Buchoire, a village of the dead, without lights, doors
creaking open at the touch of the wind.</p>

<p>We halted there to water the horses and give them what
forage could be scraped together. The Scot and I rode
on alone to Guivry, another seven kilometres. As we
neared it so the sound of guns increased again as though
a military band had died away round one corner and
came presently marching back round another, playing
the same air, getting louder as it came.</p>

<p>In a small room lit by oil lamps, Generals and Staffs
were bending over huge maps scored heavily with red
and blue pencils. Telephones buzzed and half conversations
with tiny voices coming from back there kept all
the others silent. Orderlies came in motor overalls
with all the dust of France over them.</p>

<p>They gave us food,&mdash;whisky, bully and bread, apples
with which we filled our pockets. Of our Corps they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
knew nothing, but after much telephoning they
“thought” we should find them at Château Beines.</p>

<p>The Scot and I looked at one another. Château
Beines was ten minutes from the burning hangars.
We had passed it on our way down empty, silent, hours
ago, in another life. Would the horses get us back up
that interminable climb? Who should we find when
we got there&mdash;our people or Germans? We rode back
to Buchoire and distributed apples to the Babe, the
Stand-by and the others and broke it to them that we
had to go back on the chance of finding our brigade.
The horses had been watered but not fed.</p>

<p>We turned about and caught up French transport
which had blocked the road in both directions. We
straightened them out, a wagon at a time, after endless
wagging of hands and tongues and finally got to Château
Beines to find a French Headquarters installed there
who knew nothing about our brigade. There were English
artillery in the farm a mile farther.</p>

<p>We went there. The farm was a ruin wreathed in
fog, but from beneath the now smoking hangars a battery
of ours was spitting shells into the night. Headquarters
was somewhere in the farm cellar. We followed up a
chink of light to its source and found a row of officers
lying on wooden beds of rabbit netting, a signaller squatting
on a reel of wire in the corner over a guttering candle,
the concrete roof dripping moisture upon them. It was
3 a.m.</p>

<p>Orders were to come into action at once and open
fire on a certain main-road junction.</p>

<p>The Scot and I went out and scoured ploughed fields
waist-deep in drifting mist, looking for a position, found
a belt of turf on the edge of a road and fetched the guns
up. Locating the position on the map, working out the
angle of the line of fire and the range with protractors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
took us back to the cellar where those lucky devils who
were not commanding batteries were lying stertorous.
Horses and men sweated their heart’s blood in getting
the guns into position on the spongy ground and within
an hour the first ear-splitting cracks joined in the chorus
of screaming resistance put up by the other two batteries,
with gunners who lost their balance at the weight of a
shell and fell upon their faces, picking themselves up
without even an oath and loading up again in a stupor
by a process of sub-conscious reflex energy.</p>

<p>What are the limits of human endurance? Are
there any? We had three more days and nights of it
and still those men went on.</p>


<h3>25</h3>

<p>Sometime or other the Babe, the Stand-by and the
other lad got some tea down in the cellar and fell asleep
over their cups. Sometime or other I too got some tea,
closed my eyes and fell off the box on which I was sitting.
Sometime or other we got the order to cease fire and seek
covered positions for the day’s work. Time, as one
ordinarily recognizes it, had ceased. There was no night,
marked by rest, nor day divided off into duties and meals.
Time was all one, a blurry mixture of dark and cold;
light, which hurt one’s eyes, and sweat. Sleep and rest
were not. What was happening we did not know. It
might have been the end of the world and we shouldn’t
have known till we were in the next. There were just
guns to be fired at given points for ever and ever, always
and always, world with or without end, amen. Guns,
guns and nothing but guns, in front, behind, right and
left, narrowing down to those of mine which grew hot
and were sponged out and went on again and still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
on, unhurriedly, remorselessly into the German advance,
and would go on long and long after I was dead.</p>

<p>One’s mind refused to focus anything but angles
and ranges and ammunition supply. There was nothing
of importance in the world but those three things, whether
we moved on or stayed where we were, whether we walked
or whether we rode, whether we ate or whether we
starved. In a sort of detached fog one asked questions
and gave orders about food and forage and in the same
fog food eventually appeared while one stared at the map
and whispered another range which the Stand-by shouted
down the line of guns.</p>

<p>With spades we cut a gap in a hedge which shut off
an orchard from the road. The ditch was filled with
stones and bricks from the farm. The horses took the
guns in one by one, and other gaps were cut in the front
hedge for the gun muzzles. Platforms were dug and
trail beds, and ammunition began to pile up beside each
gun as the sun came out and thinned the fog.</p>

<p>A telephone line ran away across the fields and a new
voice came through the receiver, tickling one’s ear,&mdash;that
of an uncaptured Colonel of a captured brigade who
honoured us by taking command of our brigade. With
a shaven face and washed hands he had looked upon our
bearded chins and foul appearance and talked of the
condition of our horses.</p>

<p>In front of the guns a long line of French machine
gunners had dug themselves in and we were on the top
of a high ridge. Below us the ground sloped immediately
away to a beautiful green valley which rose up again
to a feathery wood about to burst into green and ran
past it in undulations like the green rollers of the Atlantic.
Away in the distance were the great bulbous ever-watching
eyes of the enemy,&mdash;balloons, which as the sun came
up, advanced steadily, hypnotically, many of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
strung out in a long line. Presently from the wood below
came trickling streams of men, like brown insects coming
from a dead horse. The sun glinted on their rifles.
Steadily they came, unhurriedly, plodding up to the ridge,
hundreds of them, heedless of the enemy barrage which
began climbing too in great hundred-yard jumps.</p>

<p>“What news?” said I, as one trickle reached me.
It was led by a Colonel.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “We’ve been relieved by the
French,” said he, not stopping.</p>

<p>“Relieved? But God’s truth, isn’t there a war
on?”</p>

<p>“Who the hell are you talking to?” He flung it
over his shoulder and his men followed him away.</p>

<p>Somehow it didn’t seem credible. And yet there all
along the ridge and the valley was the entire British
infantry, or what looked like it, leisurely going back,
while the French machine gunners looked at them and
chattered. I got on the ’phone to Brigade about it.
The Colonel said, “Yes, I know.”</p>

<p>We went on firing at long range. The teams were
just behind the guns, each one under an apple tree,
the drivers lying beside their horses. The planes which
came over didn’t see us. The other batteries were in
the open behind the crest tucked into folds of the ground,
all the wagon lines clinging to a farmhouse about a mile
back where the headquarters was. The Hun barrage
was quickly coming nearer.</p>

<p>A troop of cavalry trotted down into it and took
cover under one end of the wood. They had only one
casualty. A shell struck a tree and brought it crashing
down on top of a horse and rider. The last of our infantry
had passed behind us and the wood was empty
again. The opposite ridge was unoccupied; glasses
showed no one in the country that stretched away on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the left. Only the balloons seemed almost on top of
us. The cavalry left the wood and trotted over the
ridge in a long snake of half sections, and then the fringe
of the barrage reached us. It splashed into the orchard.
Drivers leaped to the horses’ heads. No man or animal
was touched. Again one heard it coming, instinctively
crouching at its shriek. Again it left us untouched as
with an inattentive eye I saw the cavalry come trotting
quietly back. It was followed by a chattering of the
French. The reason was obvious. Out of the wood
other streams came trickling, blue this time, in little
parties of four and five, momentarily increasing in number
and pace.</p>

<p>The first lot reached the battery and said they were
the second line. The Boche was a “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sale race, b’en zut
alors!</i>” and hitching their packs they passed on.</p>

<p>The machine gunners began to get ready. The battery
began to look at me. The Stand-by gave them another
salvo for luck and then ordered ten rounds per gun to
be set at fuse 6&mdash;the edge of the wood was about fifteen
hundred.</p>

<p>The next stream of poilus was hotter. They sweated
much all among the orchard and told me with a laugh
that the Boche would be here in five minutes. But
when I suggested that they should stay and see what
we could do together they shrugged their shoulders,
spat, said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En route!</i>” and en routed.</p>

<p>The gunners had finished setting the fuses and were
talking earnestly together. The machine gunners weren’t
showing much above ground. The barrage had passed
over to our rear.</p>

<p>I called up the Colonel again and told him. He told
me I could drop the range to three thousand.</p>

<p>The Stand-by passed the order. It got about as far
as the first gun and there died of inanition. The battery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
was so busy talking about the expected arrival of the
Boche that orders faded into insignificance. The Stand-by
repeated the order. Again it was not passed. I
tried a string of curses but nothing more than a whisper
would leave my throat. The impotence of it was the
last straw. I whispered to the Stand-by to repeat word
for word what I said. He megaphoned his hands and
you could have heard him across the Channel,&mdash;a lovely
voice, a bull of Bashan, that rose above the crash of
shells and reached the last man at the other end of the
line of guns. What he repeated was totally unprintable.
If voice failed me, vocabulary hadn’t. I rose to heights
undreamed of by even the Tidworth sergeant-major.</p>

<p>At the end of two minutes we began a series which
for smartness, jump, drive, passing and execution of
orders would have put a Salisbury depot battery into
the waste-paper basket. Never in my life have I seen
such gunnery as those fellows put up. Salvos went over
like one pistol shot. Six rounds battery fire one second
were like the ticking of a stop watch. Gun fire was like
the stoking of the fires of hell by demons on hot cinders.</p>

<p>One forgot to be tired, one forgot to look out for
the Hun in the joy of that masterly performance, a
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fortissima cantata</span> on a six pipe organ of death and hate.
Five minutes, ten minutes? I don’t know, but the pile
of empty shell cases became a mountain behind each
gun.</p>

<p>A signaller tugged at my arm and I went to the
’phone.</p>

<p>“Retire immediately! Rendezvous at Buchoire!”</p>

<p>I was still caught up with the glory of that shooting.</p>

<p>“What the hell for?” said I. “I can hang on here
for ages yet.”</p>

<p>“Retire immediately!” repeated the Colonel.</p>

<p>I came to earth with a bang and began to apologize.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
Somehow it doesn’t do to talk like that to one’s Colonel
even in moments of spiritual exaltation.</p>

<p>We ceased fire and packed up and got mounted and
hooked in like six bits of black ginger, but the trouble
was that we had to leave the comparative safety of our
orchard and go out into the barrage which was churning
up the fields the other side of the hedge. I collected
the Stand-by and gave him the plan of campaign. They
were to follow me in column of route at a trot, with twenty
yards between guns,&mdash;that is, at right angles to the
barrage, so as to form a smaller target. No man can
have failed to hear his voice but for some unknown reason
they failed to carry out the order. The leading gun
followed me over the ditch on to the field, shells bursting
on every side. About sixty yards across the field I looked
over my shoulder and saw that they were all out of the
orchard but wheeling to form line, broadside on to the
barrage.</p>

<p>The leading gun, which the Stand-by took on, was the
only one that got safely away. The five others all stuck
with horses dead and men wounded, and still that barrage
dropped like hail.</p>

<p>We cut out the dead horses and shot the badly wounded
ones and somehow managed a four-horse team for each
gun. The wounded who couldn’t walk were lifted on
to limbers and held there by the others, and the four-horse
teams nearly broke their hearts before we got the
guns off that devilish bit of ploughed land on to a road,
and after another twenty minutes had got out of the
shell fire. Three sergeants were wounded, a couple of
drivers and a gunner. The road was one solid mass of
moving troops, French and English, infantry, gunners
and transport. There was no means of going cross-country
with four-horse teams. One had to follow the
stream. Fortunately there were some R.A.M.C. people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
with stretchers and there was a motor ambulance. Between
the two we got all our casualties bandaged and
away. The other batteries had been gone already
three quarters of an hour. There was no sign of them
anywhere.</p>

<p>My own battery was scattered along a mile of traffic;
one gun here, another there, divided by field kitchens
and French mitrailleuse carts, marching infantry and
limbered G.S. wagons. Where the sergeant-major was
with the wagon line was beyond the bounds of conjecture.
One hoped to find him at the rendezvous at
Buchoire. There was nothing with us in the way of
rations or forage and we only had the limbers full of
ammunition. Fortunately the men had had a midday
ration issued in the orchard, and the horses had been
watered and fed during the morning. In the way of
personnel I had the Quartermaster-sergeant, and two
sergeants. The rest were bombardiers, gunners, and
drivers,&mdash;about three men per gun all told. The outlook
was not very optimistic.</p>

<p>The view itself did not tend to lighten one’s depression.
We climbed a fairly steep slope which gave a view of the
country for miles on either side. The main roads and
every little crossroad as far as the eye could carry were
all massed with moving troops going back. It looked
like the Allied armies in full retreat, quite orderly but
none the less routed. Where would it end? From
rumours which ran about we were almost surrounded.
The only way out was south. We were inside a bottle
which we could not break, all aiming for the neck.</p>

<p>And yet everywhere on that slope French infantry
had dug themselves in, each man in a little hole about
knee-deep with a tiny bank of mud in front of him,
separated from the next man by a few yards. They sat
and smoked in their holes, so like half-dug graves, waiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
for the enemy, watching us go back with a look in their
eyes that seemed to be of scorn. Now and again they
laughed. It was difficult to meet those quiet eyes without
a surge of rage and shame. How much longer were
we going to retreat? Where were our reinforcements?
Why had our infantry been “relieved” that morning?
Why weren’t we standing shoulder to shoulder with those
blue-clad poilus? What was the brain at the back of
it all? Who was giving the orders? Was this the
end of the war? Were we really beaten? Could it
be possible that somewhere there was not a line of defence
which we could take up and hold, hold for ever?
Surely with magnificent men like ours who fought till
they dropped and then picked themselves up and fought
again, surely something could be done to stop this appalling
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débâcle!</span></p>


<h3>26</h3>

<p>The tide of traffic took us into Guiscard where we
were able to pull out of the stream one by one and collect
as a battery,&mdash;or at least the gun part of it. While
studying the map a mounted orderly came up and
saluted.</p>

<p>“Are you the &mdash;&mdash; Brigade, sir?” he said.</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>“The orders are to rendezvous at Muiraucourt instead
of Buchoire.”</p>

<p>To this day that man remains a mystery. The rest
of the brigade did rendezvous at Buchoire and fought
twice again that day. The Colonel never gave any order
about Muiraucourt and had never heard of the place.
Where the orderly came from, who he was, or how he
knew the number of the brigade are unsolved problems.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
I never saw him again. Having given the message he
disappeared into the stream of traffic, and I, finding
the new rendezvous to be only about three kilometres
away in a different direction to Buchoire and out of the
traffic road led on again at once.</p>

<p>We passed French gunners of all calibres firing at
extreme range and came to Muiraucourt to find it absolutely
empty and silent. While the horses were
being watered and the wounded ones bandaged I scouted
on ahead and had the luck to find an A.S.C. officer with
forage for us and a possibility of rations if we waited an
hour. It was manna in the wilderness.</p>

<p>We drew the forage and fed the starving horses. At
the end of the hour an A.S.C. sergeant rode in to say that
the ration wagons had been blown up.&mdash;We took up an
extra hole in our Sam Brownes. It appeared that he
had seen our headquarters and the other batteries marching
along the main road in the direction of Noyon, to
which place they were undoubtedly going.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster whispered something about bread
and tea. So we withdrew from the village and halted
on a field just off the road and started a fire. The bread
ration was a snare and a delusion. It worked out at about
one slice per every other man. He confided this to me
sadly while the men were spread-eagled on the bank
at the roadside, enjoying all the anticipation of a full
stomach. We decided that it wasn’t a large enough
quantity to split up so I went over and put the position
to them, telling them that on arrival at Noyon we hoped
to find the brigade looking out for us with a meal for
everybody ready. Meanwhile there wasn’t enough to
go round. What about tossing for it?... The ayes
had it. They tossed as if they were going to a football
match, the winners sending up a cheer, and even the
losers sitting down again with a grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>I decided to ride on into Noyon and locate the brigade
and find out where to get rations. So I handed the
battery to the Stand-by to bring on when ready, left
him the Babe and the other lad, and took the Quartermaster
on with me.</p>

<p>It was a nightmare of a ride through miles and miles
of empty villages and deserted country, blown-up bridges
like stricken giants blocking every way, not a vehicle
on the roads, no one in sight, the spirit of desertion
overhanging it all, with the light failing rapidly and Noyon
apparently as far off as ever. The horses were so done
that it was difficult to spur them out of a walk, we ourselves
so done that we could hardly raise the energy to
spur them. At last after hours of riding we came to
the main Roye-Noyon road but didn’t recognize it in
the dark and turned the wrong way, going at least half
an hour before we discovered our mistake! It was the
last straw.</p>

<p>A thing that added to our anxiety was the sight of
big guns on caterpillars all coming away from the place
we were going to and as we got nearer the town the
roar of bursting shells seemed to be very near. One didn’t
quite know that streams of the enemy would not pour
over the crest at any minute. Deep in one’s brain a
vague anxiety formed. The whole country was so
empty, the bridges so well destroyed. Were we the
last&mdash;had we been cut off? Was the Hun between us
and Noyon? Suppose the battery were captured?
I began to wish that I hadn’t ridden on but had sent
the Stand-by in my place. For the first time since the
show began, a sense of utter loneliness overwhelmed
me, a bitter despair at the uselessness of individual effort
in this gigantic tragedy of apocalyptic destruction. Was
it a shadow of such loneliness as Christ knew upon the
Cross when He looked out upon a storm-riven world and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
cried, “My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?”
All the evil in the world was gathered here in shrieking
orgy, crushing one to such mental and physical tiredness
that death would only have been a welcome rest.</p>

<p>Unaided I should not have regretted that way out,
God knows. But two voices came to me through the
night,&mdash;one from a little cottage among the pine trees in
England, the other calling across the Atlantic with the
mute notes of a violin.</p>

<p>“Your men look to you,” they whispered. “<em>We</em>
look to you....”</p>


<h3>27</h3>

<p>We came to Noyon!</p>

<p>It was as though the town were a magnet which had
attracted all the small traffic from that empty countryside,
letting only the big guns on caterpillars escape.
The centre of the town, like a great octopus, has seven
roads which reach out in every direction. Each of
these was banked and double-banked with an interlocked
mass of guns and wagons. Here and there frantic
officers tried to extricate the tangle but for the most part
men sat silent and inert upon their horses and vehicles
beyond effort and beyond care.</p>

<p>Army Headquarters told me that Noyon would begin
to be shelled in an hour’s time and gave me maps and
a chit to draw food from the station, but they had never
heard of the brigade and thought the Corps had been
wiped out. As I left, the new lad came up and reported
that the battery had halted on the outskirts of the town.
We went back to it and collected the limbers and tried
to take them with us to the station, with hearts beating
high at the thought of food. It was impossible, so we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
left them on the pavement and dodged single file between
wagon wheels and horses’ legs. After an hour’s
fighting every yard of the way we got to the station
to find a screaming mob of civilians carrying bundles,
treading on each other in their efforts to enter a train,
weeping, praying, cursing, out of all control.</p>

<p>The R.S.O. had gone. There was no food.</p>

<p>We fought our way back to Army Headquarters
where we learned that a bombardier with two wagons
of rations destined to feed stray units like us had gone
to Porquericourt, five kilometres out. If we found him
we could help ourselves. If we didn’t find him&mdash;a
charming smile, and a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>I decided to try the hotel where I had spent a night
with my brother only three weeks ago. Three weeks,
was it possible? I felt years older. The place was
bolted and barred and no amount of hammering or shouting
drew an answer. The thought of going back empty-handed
to my hungry battery was an agony. The chances
of finding that bombardier were about one in a million,
so small that he didn’t even represent a last hope. In
utter despair one called aloud upon Christ and started
to walk back. In a narrow unlit street we passed a black
doorway in which stood a soldier.</p>

<p>“Can you give me a drink of water?” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he. “Come in, sir. This is the officers’
club.”</p>

<p>Was it luck? Or did Christ hear? You may think
what you like but I am convinced that it was Christ.</p>

<p>We went in. In one room were sleeping officers
all over the floor. The next was full of dinner tables
uncleared, one electric light burning. It was long
after midnight. We helped ourselves to bits of bread
from each table and drank the leavings of milk which
had been served with the coffee. Then a waiter came.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
He said he would cook us some tea and try and find a
cold tongue or some ham. I told him that I had a
starving battery down the road and wanted more than
tea and ham. I wanted food in a sack, two sacks, everything
he could rake up, anything.</p>

<p>He blinked at me through his glasses. “I’ll see
what I can do, sir,” he said and went away.</p>

<p>We had our tea and tongue and he brought a huge
sack with loaves and tins of jam and bits of cheese and
biscuits and packets of cigarettes and tins of bully.
Furthermore he refused all payment except two francs
for what we had eaten.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, sir,” he said. “I spent three days
in a shell hole outside Wipers on one tin o’ bully.&mdash;That’s
the best I can do for you.”</p>

<p>I wrung him by the hand and told him he was a brother
and a pal, and between us the lad and I shouldered the
sack and went out again, thanking God that at least we
had got something for the men to eat.</p>

<p>On returning to the battery I found that they had
been joined by six wagons which had got cut off from
the sergeant-major’s lot and the entire wagon line of the
Scots Captain’s battery with two of his subalterns in
charge. They, too, were starving.</p>

<p>The sack didn’t go very far. It only took a minute
or so before the lot was eaten. Then we started out,
now a column about a mile long, to find Porquericourt,
a tiny village some two kilometres off the main road, the
gunners sleeping as they walked, the drivers rocking in
the saddle, the horses stumbling along at a snail’s pace.
None of us had shaved or washed since the 21st. We were
a hollow-eyed, draggled mob, but we got there at last
to be challenged by sentries who guarded sleeping bits of
units who had dropped where they stood all over the
place. While my two units fixed up a wagon line I took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the Quartermaster with me and woke up every man
under a wagon or near one asking him if he were Bombardier
So and So,&mdash;the man with the food. How they
cursed me. It took me an hour to go the rounds and there
was no bombardier with food. The men received the news
without comment and dropped down beside the wagons.
The Babe had collected a wagon cover for us to sleep under
and spread it under a tree. The four of us lay on it
side by side and folded the end over ourselves. There
was a heavy dew. But my job wasn’t over. There
was to-morrow to be considered. I had given orders to
be ready to move off at six o’clock unless the Hun arrived
before that. It was then 3 a.m.</p>

<p>The Army had told me that if our Corps was not
completely wiped out, their line of retreat was Buchoire,
Crissolles and so back in the direction of Lassigny. They
advised me to go to Crissolles. But one look at the map
convinced me that Crissolles would be German by six
o’clock in the morning. So I decided on Lagny by the
secondary road which went straight to it from Porquericourt.
If the brigade was not there, surely there would
be some fighting unit who would have heard of them,
or who might at least be able to spare us rations, or
tell us where we could get some. Fighting on scraps
of bread was all right but could not be prolonged indefinitely.</p>

<p>At six o’clock we set out as a squadron of cavalry
with slung lances trotted like ghosts across the turf.
We had only been on the march five minutes when a
yell from the rear of the battery was passed quickly
up to me as I walked in the lead.</p>

<p>“Halt! Action rear!”</p>

<p>My heart stood still. Were the Germans streaming
up in the mist? Were we caught at last like rats in a
trap? It <em>couldn’t</em> be. It was some fool mistake. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Babe was riding just behind me. I called him up. “Canter
back and find out who gave that order and bring
him here.&mdash;You, lead driver! Keep on walking till
I give you the order to do anything else.”</p>

<p>We went on steadily. From moment to moment
nothing seemed to happen, no rifle or machine-gun fire.&mdash;The
Babe came back with a grin. “The order was
‘All correct in rear,’ sir.”</p>

<p>Can you get the feeling of relief? We were not
prisoners or fighting to the last man with clubbed rifles
in that cold grey dawn on empty stomachs.</p>

<p>I obeyed the natural instinct of all mothers who
see their child snatched from destruction,&mdash;to slap
the infant. “Find out the man who passed it up wrongly
and damn his soul to hell?”</p>

<p>“Right, sir,” said the Babe cheerily, and went back.
Good Babe, he couldn’t damn even a mosquito properly!</p>

<p>The road was the most ungodly track imaginable,
blocked here and there by 60-pounders coming into action.
But somehow the horses encompassed the impossible
and we halted in the lane outside the village at about
seven o’clock. The Stand-by remained in charge of the
battery while the Babe and I went across gardens to get
to the village square. There was an old man standing at
a door. He gazed at us motionless. I gave him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon
jour</i> and asked him for news of British troops, gunners.
Yes, the village was full. Would we care for some cider?
Wouldn’t we! He produced jugfuls of the most perfect
cider I’ve ever drunk and told us the story of his life.
He was a veteran of 1870 and wept all down himself
in the telling. We thanked him profusely, shook his
trembling hand and went out of his front door into the
main street.</p>

<p>There were wagons with the brigade mark! I could
have wept with joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>In a couple of minutes we had found Headquarters.
The man I’d dosed with champagne on the road corner
two days before fell on my neck with strong oaths. It
appeared that I’d been given up as wiped out with the
whole battery, or at least captured. He looked upon me
as back from the dead.</p>

<p>The Colonel had a different point of view. He was
no longer shaved and washed, and threatened to put me
under arrest for not having rendezvoused at Buchoire!
Relations between us were strained, but everybody was
in the act of getting mounted to reconnoitre positions so
there was no time for explanations or recriminations.
Within three-quarters of an hour the battery was in action,
but the Quartermaster had found the sergeant-major,
who, splendid fellow, had our rations. He functioned
mightily with cooks. Tea and bacon, bread and butter,&mdash;what
could the “Carlton” have done better than
that?</p>

<p>And later, when the sun came out, there was no
firing to be done, and we slept beside the gun wheels
under an apple tree, slept like the dead for nearly a
whole hour.</p>


<h3>28</h3>

<p>The Hun was indeed at Crissolles, for the brigade
had fought there the previous evening. So much for
Army advice.</p>

<p>The day was marked by two outstanding events;
one, the return of the Major of the Scots Captain’s
battery, his wound healed, full of bloodthirst and cheeriness;
the other, that I got a shave and wash. We advanced
during the morning to cover a village called
Bussy. We covered it,&mdash;with gun fire and salvos, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
signal for each salvo being a wave from my shaving
brush. There was a hell of a battle in Bussy, street
fighting with bayonets and bombs. The brigade dropped
a curtain of fire on the outer fringe of the village and
caught the enemy in full tide. Four batteries sending
over between them a hundred rounds a minute of high
explosive and shrapnel can make a nasty mess of a pin-point.
The infantry gloated,&mdash;our infantry.</p>

<p>On our right Noyon was the centre of a whirlwind
of Hun shells. We were not out any too soon. The
thought added zest to our gun fire. Considering the
amount of work those guns had done in the last five days
and nights it was amazing how they remained in action
without even breaking down. The fitter worked like a
nigger and nursed them like infants. Later the Army took
him from me to go and drive rivets in ships!</p>

<p>We pulled out of action again as dusk was falling,
and the word was passed that we had been relieved
and were going out of the line. The brigade rendezvoused
at Cuy in a field off the road while the traffic
crept forward a yard and halted, waited an hour and
advanced another yard, every sort of gun, wagon, lorry,
ambulance and car, crawling back, blocked at every
crossroads, stuck in ditches, sometimes abandoned.</p>

<p>All round the sky glared redly. Hour after hour
we sat in that cup of ground waiting for orders, shivering
with cold, sleeping in uneasy snatches, smoking tobacco
that ceased to taste, nibbling ration biscuits until the
night became filled with an eerie strained silence. Jerky
sentences stopped. Faint in the distance came the crunch
of wheels, a vague undercurrent of sound. The guns had
stopped. Now and again the chink of a horse mumbling
his bit. The tail end of the traffic on the road below us
was silent, waiting, the men huddled, asleep. And
through it all one’s ear listened for a new sound, the sound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
of marching feet, or trotting horses which might mean an
Uhlan patrol. Bussy was not far.</p>

<p>Suddenly one voice, far away, distinct, pierced the
darkness like a thin but blinding ray. “Les Boches!&mdash;Les
Boches!”</p>

<p>A sort of shivering rustle ran over the whole brigade.
Men stirred, sat up, muttered. Horses raised their heads
with a rattle of harness. Hands crept to revolvers.
Every breath was held and every head stared in the
direction of the voice.</p>

<p>For a moment the silence was spellbound.</p>

<p>Then the voice came again, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A gauche! A gauche!
Nom de Dieu!</i>” and the crunch of wheels came again.</p>

<p>The brigade relaxed. There came a laugh or two, a
mumbled remark, a settling down, a muttered curse and
then silence once more.</p>

<p>Eventually came a stir, an order. Voices were raised.
Sleeping figures rolled over stiffly, staggered up. Officers
came forward. The order “Get mounted!” galvanized
everybody.</p>

<p>Wagon by wagon we pulled out of the field. My
battery was the last. No sooner on the road, with
our noses against the tailboard of the last vehicle of
the battery in front, than we had to halt again and
wait endlessly, the drivers sleeping in their saddles
until pulled out by the N.C.O.’s, the gunners flinging themselves
into the ditch. At last on again, kicking the sleepers
awake,&mdash;the only method of rousing them. It was
very cold. To halt was as great an agony as to march,
whether mounted or on foot. For five days and nights
one had had one’s boots on. The condition of feet was
indescribable. In places the road was blocked by abandoned
motor lorries. We had to extemporize bridges
over the ditch with rocks and tins and whatever was in
the lorries with a tailboard placed on top, to unhook lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
horses from a four-horse gun team and hook them into
a loaded wagon to make a six-horse team, to rouse the
drivers sufficiently to make them drive properly and get
the full team to work together, and at last, having reached
a good metalled road, to follow the battery in front,
limping and blind, hour after hour. From time to time
the gunners and drivers changed places. For the most
part no word was spoken. We halted when the teams
bumped their noses on the wagon in front, went on again
when those in front did. At one halt I sat on a gun seat,
the unforgivable sin for a gunner on the line of march,&mdash;and
I was the Battery Commander. Sprawled over the
breech of the gun in a stupor I knew no more for an indefinite
period when I woke again to find us still marching.
The sergeant-major confided to me afterwards that he
was so far my accomplice in that lack of discipline that
he posted a gunner on either side to see that I didn’t fall
off. We had started the march about five o’clock in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>We didn’t reach our destination till nine o’clock
next morning. The destination consisted of halting
in the road outside a village already full of troops,
Chevrincourt. The horses were unhooked and taken off
the road, watered, and tied to lines run up between the
trees. Breakfast was cooked, and having ascertained
that we were not going to move for the rest of the day we
spread our valises, and got into pyjamas, not caring if it
snowed ink.</p>


<h3>29</h3>

<p>We stayed there two days, doing nothing but water
and feed the horses and sleep. I succeeded in getting
letters home the first morning, having the luck to meet a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
junior Brass Hat who had done the retreat in a motor-car.
It was good to be able to put an end to their anxiety.
Considering all things we had been extraordinarily
lucky. The number of our dead, wounded and missing
was comparatively slight and the missing rolled up later,
most of them. On the second night at about two in the
morning, Battery Commanders were summoned urgently
to Brigade Headquarters. The Colonel had gone, leaving
the bloodthirsty Major in command. It transpired that
a Divisional brigade plus one battery of ours was to go
back into the line. They would take our best guns,
some of our best teams and our best sergeants. The
exchanges were to be carried out at once. They were.</p>

<p>We marched away that day, leaving one battery
behind. As it happened, it didn’t go into the line again
but rejoined us a week later.</p>

<p>The third phase of the retreat, marching back to
the British area&mdash;we were far south into the French
area at Chevrincourt, which is near Compiègne, and
all its signboards showed Paris so many kilometres
away&mdash;gave us an impression of the backwash of war.
The roads were full, not of troops, but of refugees, women,
old men, girls and children, with what possessions they
could load into a farm wagon piled sky high. They pulled
their cattle along by chains or ropes tied round their
horns. Some of them pushed perambulators full of
packages and carried their babies. Others staggered under
bundles. Grief marked their faces. The hope of
return kept them going. The French have deeper roots
in the soil than we. To them their “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patelin</i>” is the
world and all the beauty thereof. It was a terrible
sight to see those poor women trudging the endless roads,
void of a goal as long as they kept away from the pursuing
death, half starved, sleeping unwashed in leaky
barns, regardless of sex, begging milk from the inhabited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
villages they passed through to satisfy their unhappy
babies, managing somehow to help the aged and infirm
who mumbled bitter curses at the “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sale Boche</i>” and
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soixante-dix</i>.” I heard one woman say “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous savons
c’qu c’est que la guerre! Nous avons tout fait excepté
les tranchées.</i>” “We know what war is. We have done
everything except the trenches.” Bombarded with gas
and long-range guns, bombed by aeroplanes, homeless,
half starved, the graves of their dead pillaged by ghoul-like
Huns, their sons, husbands, and lovers killed, indeed
they knew the meaning of war.</p>

<p>England has been left in merciful ignorance of this
side of war, but woe unto her if she ever forgets that these
women of France are her blood-sisters, these peasant
women who later gave food to the emaciated Tommies
who staggered back starving after the armistice, food of
which they denied themselves and their children.</p>

<p>On the third day we reached Poix where only three
months previously we had spent a merry Christmas and
drunk the New Year in, the third day of ceaseless marching
and finding billets in the middle of the night in villages
crowded with refugees. The whole area was full, British
and French elbowing each other, the unfortunate refugees
being compelled to move on.</p>

<p>Here we exchanged old guns for new, received reinforcements
of men and horses, drew new equipment in
place of that which was destroyed and lost, found time to
ride over to Bergicourt to pay our respects to the little
Abbé, still unshaved, who was now billeting Moroccan
troops, and who kissed us on both cheeks before all the
world, and in three more days were on our way to their
firing line again.</p>

<p>It was here that the runaway servants were dealt
with; here, too, that my brother came rolling up in
his car to satisfy himself that I was still this side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
eternity or capture. And very good it was to see him.
He gave us the number of divisions engaged against us,
and we marvelled again that any of us were still alive.</p>

<p>We went north this time for the defence of Amiens,
having been joined by our fourth battery, and relieved
a brigade in action behind the village of Gentelles. The
Anzacs were in the line from Villers Brettoneux to Hangard
where their flank touched the French. The spire of
Amiens cathedral peeped up behind us and all day long-range
shells whizzed over our heads into the stricken city.</p>

<p>Some one was dissatisfied with our positions behind
the village. The range was considered too long. Accordingly
we were ordered to go forward and relieve some
other batteries down the slope in front of Gentelles. The
weather had broken. It rained ceaselessly. The whole
area was a mud patch broken by shell holes. The Major,
who had remained behind at Chevrincourt, and I went
forward together to locate the forward batteries. Dead
horses everywhere, and fresh graves of men marked our
path. Never have I seen such joy on any faces as on
those of the officers whom we were coming to relieve.</p>

<p>On our return we reported unfavourably, urging
strongly that we should remain where we were. The
order was inexorable. That night we went in.</p>

<p>We stayed there three days, at the end of which time
we were withdrawn behind the village again. Our dead
were three officers&mdash;one of whom was the Babe&mdash;half the
gunners, and several drivers. Our wounded were one
officer and half the remaining gunners. Of the guns
themselves about six in the brigade were knocked out
by direct hits.</p>

<p>Who was that dissatisfied “some one” who, having
looked at a map from the safety of a back area, would not
listen to the report of two Majors, one a regular, who had
visited the ground and spoke from their bitterly-earned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
experience? Do the ghosts of those officers and men,
unnecessarily dead, disturb his rest o’ nights, or is he
proudly wearing another ribbon for distinguished service?
Even from the map he ought to have known better. It
was the only place where a fool would have put guns.
The German artillery judged him well.</p>

<p>Poor Babe, to be thrown away at the beginning of
his manhood at the dictate of some ignorant and cowardly
Brass Hat!</p>

<p>“Young, unmarried men, your King and country
need you!”</p>


<h3>30</h3>

<p>So we crawled out of the valley of death. With
what remained of us in men and guns we formed three
batteries, two of which went back to their original positions
behind the village and in disproof of their uselessness
fired four thousand rounds a day per battery, fifty-six
wagon-loads of ammunition. The third battery tucked
itself into a corner of the village and remained there till
its last gun had been knocked out. One S.O.S. lasted
thirty-six hours. One lived with a telephone and a map.
Sleep was unknown. Food was just food, eaten when the
servants chose to bring it. The brain reeled under the
stupendousness of the strain and the firing. For cover
we lived in a hole in the ground, some four feet deep
with a tarpaulin to keep the rain out. It was just big
enough to hold us all. The wings of the angel of death
brushed our faces continuously. Letters from home were
read without being understood. One watched men
burned to death in the battery in front, as the result of
a direct hit, without any emotion. If there be a hell
such as the Church talks about, then indeed we had
reached it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>We got a new Colonel here, and the bloodthirsty
Major returned to his battery, the Scots Captain
having been one of the wounded. My own Captain
rolled up again too, having been doing all sorts of weird
fighting up and down the line. It was only now that
we learned the full extent of the retreat and received an
order of the day from the Commander in Chief to the effect
that England had its back up against the wall. In other
words the Hun was only to pass over our dead bodies.
He attempted it at every hour of the day and night. The
Anzacs lost and retook Villers Brettoneux. The enemy
got to Cachy, five hundred yards in front of the guns,
and was driven back again. The French Colonials filled
Hangard Wood with their own and German dead, the
wounded leaving a trail of blood day and night past our
hole in the ground. The Anzacs revelled in it. They
had never killed so many men in their lives. Their
General, a great tall man of mighty few words, was round
the outpost line every day. He was much loved. Every
officer and man would gladly have stopped a shell for him.</p>

<p>At last we were pulled out of the line, at half an
hour’s notice. Just before hooking in&mdash;the teams
were on the position&mdash;there was a small S.O.S. lasting
five minutes. My battery fired four hundred rounds in
that time,&mdash;pretty good going for men who had come
through such an inferno practically without sleep for
fifteen days.</p>

<p>We sat under a haystack in the rain for forty-eight
hours and the Colonel gave us lectures on calibration.
Most interesting!</p>

<p>I confess to having been done in completely. The
Babe’s death had been a frightful shock. His shoulder
was touching mine as he got it and I had carried him
spouting blood to the shelter of a bank. I wanted to
get away and hide. I was afraid, not of death, but of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
going on in that living hell. I was unable to concentrate
sufficiently to dictate the battery orders. I was unable
to face the nine o’clock parade and left it to the Orderly
Officer. The day’s routine made me so jumpy that I
couldn’t go near the lines or the horses. The sight of a
gun filled me with physical sickness. The effort of giving
a definite order left me trembling all over.</p>

<p>The greatest comfort I knew was to lie on my valise
in the wet straw with closed eyes and listen to “Caprice
Viennois” on the gramophone. It lifted one’s soul
with gentle hands and bore it away into infinite space
where all was quiet and full of eternal rest and beauty.
It summed up the youth of the world, the springtime of
love in all its fresh cleanness, like the sun after an April
shower transforms the universe into magic colours.</p>

<p>I think the subalterns guessed something of my trouble
for they went out of their way to help me in little
things.</p>

<p>We marched north and went into the line again behind
Albert, a murdered city whose skeleton melted before one’s
eyes under the ceaseless rain of shells from our heavy
artillery.</p>

<p>During and since the retreat the cry on all sides was
“Where the devil are the Americans?”&mdash;those mysterious
Americans who were reported to be landing at the
rate of seven a minute. What became of them after
landing? They seemed to disappear. Some had seen
them buying up Marseilles, and then painting Paris all
colours of the rainbow, but no one had yet heard of them
doing any fighting. The attitude was not very bright,
until Pershing’s offer to Foch. Then everybody said,
“Ah! <em>Now</em> we shall see something.” Our own recruits
seemed to be the dregs of England, untrained, weedy
specimens who had never seen a gun and were incapable
of learning. Yet we held the Hun all right. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
looked for the huskies from U.S.A., however, with some
anxiety.</p>

<p>At Albert we found them, specimens of them, wedged
in the line with our infantry, learning the game. Their
one desire was to go out into No Man’s Land and get to
close quarters. They brought Brother Boche or bits
of him every time. One overheard talk on one’s way
along the trenches to the O.P. “Danger?” queried one
sarcastically, “Say, I ain’t bin shot at yet.” And
another time when two officers and I had been shelled
out of the O.P. by a pip-squeak battery to our extreme
discomfort and danger, we came upon a great beefy
American standing on the fire step watching the shells
burst on the place we had just succeeded in leaving. “If
that guy don’t quit foolin’ around with that gun,” he
said thoughtfully, “some one’ll likely get hurt in a
minute.”</p>

<p>Which was all to the good. They shaped well. The
trouble apparently was that they had no guns and no
rifles.</p>

<p>Our own positions were another instance of the criminal
folly of ignorance,&mdash;great obvious white gashes in a green
field, badly camouflaged, photographed and registered
by the Hun, so placed that the lowest range to clear the
crest was 3,500 and the S.O.S. was 3,550. It meant that
if the Germans advanced only fifty yards we could not
bring fire to bear on them.</p>

<p>The dawn of our getting in was enlivened by an hour’s
bombardment with gas and four-twos. Every succeeding
dawn was the same.</p>

<p>Fortunately it proved to be a peace sector, comparatively
speaking, and I moved out of that unsavoury spot
with no more delay than was required in getting the
Colonel’s consent. It only took the death of one man to
prove my point. He was a mere gunner, not even on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
proficiency pay, so presumably it was cheap knowledge.
We buried him at midnight in pouring rain, the padre
reading the service by the light of my electric torch.
But the Colonel wasn’t there.</p>

<p>From the new position so reluctantly agreed to, we fired
many hundreds of rounds, as did our successors, and not
a single man became a casualty.</p>

<p>What is the psychology of this system of insisting
on going into childishly unsuitable positions? Do
they think the Battery Commander a coward who
balks at a strafed emplacement? Isn’t the idea of
field gunners to put their guns in such a place as will
permit them to remain in action effectively for the longest
possible time in a show? Why, therefore, occupy a
position already accurately registered by the enemy,
which he can silence at any given moment? Do they
think that a Major of two years’ experience in command
of a battery in the line has not learned at least the rudiments
of choosing positions for his guns? Do they think
it is an attempt to resent authority, or to assert their own
importance? Do they think that the difference of one
pip and a foot of braid is the boundary between omniscience
and crass stupidity?</p>

<p>In civil life if the senior partner insists on doing the
junior’s job and bungles it, the junior can resign,&mdash;and
say things.</p>

<p>While we were outside Albert we got our first leave
allotment and the ranks were permitted to return to
their wives and families for fourteen days, provided
always that they had been duly vaccinated, inoculated,
and declared free from vermin and venereal disease by
the medical officer.</p>

<p>A delightful game, the inoculation business. Army
orders are careful not to make it compulsory, but if any
man refuses to be done his commanding officer is expected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
to argue with him politely, and, if that fails, to hound
him to the needle. If he shies at the needle’s point then
his leave is stopped,&mdash;although he has sweated blood
for King and country for eighteen months or so, on a
weekly pay with which a munitioneer daily tips the waiter
at the “Carlton.” If he has been unlucky enough to get
venereal disease then his leave is stopped for a year.</p>

<p>In the next war every Tommy will be a munition maker.</p>


<h3>31</h3>

<p>The desire to get out of it, to hide, refused to leave me.</p>

<p>I wrote to my brother and asked him if he could
help me to become an R.T.O. or an M.L.O.; failing that,
a cushy liaison job miles away from shambles and responsibility
and spit and polish. He knew of the very
thing, and I was duly nominated for liaison. The weeks
went by and the nomination papers became a mass of
illegible recommendations and signatures up to the
highest Generals of the English Army and a Maréchal of
France. But the ultimate reply was that I was a Battery
Commander and therefore far too important to be allowed
to go. Considering that I was half dead and not
even allowed an opinion in the choosing of a position for
my own battery, Gilbert and Sullivan could have conceived
no more priceless paradox.</p>

<p>Somewhere about the end of May we were relieved
and went to a rest camp outside Abbeville which was
being bombed every night. A special week’s leave to
England was granted to “war-weary officers.” I sent
a subaltern and, prepared to pawn my own soul to see
England again, asked if I might go too.</p>

<p>The reply is worthy of quotation. “You don’t seem
to understand that this is a rest camp, the time when you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
are supposed to train your battery. You’ll get your
leave in the line.”</p>

<p>The camp was on turf at the edge of a deep lake.
All day the horses roamed free grazing, and the men
splashed about in the water whenever they felt inclined.
The sun shone and footballs appeared from nowhere and
there were shops in the village where they could spend
money, and Abbeville was only about a mile and a half
away. In the morning we did a little gun drill and cleaned
vehicles and harness. Concerts took place in the evenings.
Leslie Henson came with a theatrical company and gave
an excellent show. The battery enjoyed its time of
training.</p>

<p>Most of those officers who weren’t sufficiently war-weary
for the week in England, went for a couple of
days to Tréport or Paris-Plage. For myself I got forty-eight
hours in Etaples with my best pal, who was giving
shows to troops about to go up the line, feeding train-loads
of refugees and helping to bandage wounded; and
somehow or other keeping out of the way of the bombs
which wrecked the hospital and drove the reinforcement
camps to sleep in the woods on the other side of the river.
We drove out to Paris-Plage and lunched and dined and
watched the golden sea sparkling and walked back in a
moonlight filled with the droning of Gothas, the crashing
of bombs and the impotent rage of an Archie barrage.</p>

<p>Not only were there no horses to look after nor men
to handle but there was a kindred spirit to talk with when
one felt like it, or with whom to remain silent when one
didn’t. Blessed be pals, for they are few and far between,
and their value is above rubies.</p>

<p>Our rest camp came to an end with an inspection from
Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and once more we took
the trail. The battery’s adventures from then until the
first day of the attack which was to end the war can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
briefly summed up, as we saw hardly any fighting. We
went back to Albert and checked calibrations, then entrained
and went off to Flanders where we remained in
reserve near St. Omer for a fortnight or so. Then we
entrained once more and returned to Albert, but this time
south of it, behind Morlancourt.</p>

<p>There was an unusual excitement in the air and a
touch of optimism. Foch was said to have something
up his sleeve. The Hun was reported to be evacuating
Albert. The Americans had been blooded and had
come up to expectations. There was a different atmosphere
about the whole thing. On our own sector the
Hun was offensive. The night we came in he made a
raid, took two thousand yards of front line on our right,
and plastered us with gas and four-twos for several hours.
No one was hurt or gassed except myself. I got a dose of
gas. The doctor advised me to go down to the wagon
line for a couple of days, but the barrage was already in
for our attack and the Captain was in England on the
Overseas Course. The show started about 4 p.m. right
along the front.</p>

<p>It was like the 21st of March with the positions reversed.
South of us the whole line broke through
and moved forward. At Morlancourt the Hun fought
to the death. It was a sort of pivot, and for a couple
of days we pounded him. By that time the line had
ceased to bulge and was practically north and south.
Then our infantry took Morlancourt and pushed the Hun
back on to the Fricourt ridge and in wild excitement we
got the order to advance. It was about seven o’clock
at night. All Battery Commanders and the Colonel
dashed up in a car to the old front line to reconnoitre
positions. The car was missed by about twelve yards
with high explosive and we advanced in the dark, falling
over barbed wire, tumbling into shell holes, jumping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
trenches and treading on corpses through a most unpleasant
barrage. The Hun had a distinct sting in his
tail.</p>

<p>We came into position about three hundred yards
north-west of Morlancourt. The village and all the
country round stank of festering corpses, mostly German,
though now and again one came upon a British pair of
boots and puttees with legs in them,&mdash;or a whole soldier
with a pack on his back, who looked as if he were sleeping
until one saw that half his face was blown away. It
made one sick, sick with horror, whether it was our own
Tommies or a long trench chaotic with rifles, equipment,
machine guns and yellow, staring and swollen Germans.</p>

<p>The excitement of advancing died away. The “glory
of victory” was just one long butchery, one awful smell,
an orgy of appalling destruction unequalled by the
barbarians of pre-civilization.</p>

<p>Here was all the brain, energy and science of nineteen
hundred years of “progress,” concentrated on lust and
slaughter, and we called it glorious bravery and rang
church bells! Soldier poets sang their swan songs in
praise of dying for their country, their country which
gave them a period of hell, and agonizing death, then
wept crocodile tears over the Roll of Honour, and finally
returned with an easy conscience to its money-grubbing.
The gladiators did it better. At least they were permitted
a final sarcasm, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Morituri, te salutant!</i>”</p>

<p>Even gentle women at home, who are properly
frightened of mice and spank small boys caught ill-treating
an animal, even they read the flaming headlines
of the papers with a light in their eyes, and said, “How
glorious! We are winning!” Would they have said
the same if they could have been set down on that reeking
battlefield where riddled tanks splashed with blood
heaved drunkenly, ambulances continuously drove away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
with the smashed wrecks of what once were men, leaving
a trail of screams in the dust of the road, and always
the guns crashed out their pæan of hate by day and night,
ceaselessly, remorselessly, with a terrible trained hunger
to kill, and maim and wipe out?</p>

<p>There was no stopping. I was an insignificant cog
in that vast machine, but no man could stop the wheels
in their mighty revolutions. Fate stepped in, however.</p>

<p>We advanced again to Mametz, and there, mercifully,
I got another dose of gas. The effects of the first one,
seven days previously, had not worked off. This was
the last straw. Three days later it toppled me over.
The doctors labelled me and sent me home.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="noindent">The battery, commanded by I know not whom, went
on to the bitter end in that sweeping advance which
broke the Hindenburg line and brought the enemy to
his knees. Their luck held good, for occasional letters
from the subalterns told me that no one else had been
killed. The last I heard of them they were at Tréport,
enjoying life with the hope of demobilization dangling in
front of their eyes. May it not dangle too long.</p>

<p>For me the war was over. I have never fired a gun
again, nor, please God, will I ever do so.</p>

<p>In saying the war was over I was wrong. I should
have said the fighting. There were other and equally
terrible sides of this world-tragedy which I was destined
to see and feel.</p>

<p>Let me sketch briefly the facts which led to my return
to duty.</p>

<p>The Medical Authorities sent me to a place called
The Funkhole of England, a seaside town where never a
bomb from airships or raiding Gothas disturbed the
sunny calm, a community of convalescent hospitals
with a list of rules as long as your arm, hotels full of
moneyed Hebrews, who only journeyed to London by
day to make more money, and retired by night to the
security of their wives in the Funkhole, shop-keepers
who rejoiced in the war because it enabled them to put
up their prices two hundred per cent., and indecent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
flappers always ready to be picked up by any subaltern.</p>

<p>The War Office authorities hastened to notify me
that I was now reduced to subaltern, but somehow I
was “off” flappers. Another department begged me to
get well quickly, because, being no longer fit to command
a battery, I was wanted for that long-forgotten liaison
job.</p>

<p>The explanation of degrading from Major to subaltern
is not forthcoming. Perhaps the Government were
thinking of the rate payers. The difference in pay is
about two shillings and sixpence a day, and there were
many thousands of us thus reduced.&mdash;But it does not
make for an exuberant patriotism. My reply was that
if I didn’t go out as a Major, I should not hurry to get
well. This drew a telegram which stated that I was
re-appointed acting-Major while employed as liaison
officer, but what they gave with one hand they took
back with the other, for the telegram ordered me to
France again three weeks before the end of my sick leave.</p>

<p>It was a curious return. But for the fact that I was
still in uniform I might have been a mere tourist, a
spectator. The job was more “cushy” even than
that of R.T.O. or M.L.O. Was I glad? Enormously.
Was I sorry? Yes, for out there in the thick of it were
those men of mine, in a sense my children, who had
looked to me for the food they ate, the clothes they wore,
the pay they drew, the punishments they received, whose
lives had been in my keeping so long, who, for two years,
had constituted all my life, with whom I had shared good
days and bad, short rations and full, hardships innumerable,
suffering indescribable. It was impossible to live
softly and be driven in a big Vauxhall car, while they
were still out there, without a twinge of conscience,
even though one was not fit to go back to them. I slept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
in a bed with sheets, and now and again a hot bath,
receiving letters from home in four days instead of eight,
and generally enjoying all the creature comforts which
console the back-area officer for the lack of excitement
only found in the firing line. It was a period of doing
little, observing much and thinking a great deal among
those lucky ones of the earth, whose lines had been cast
in peaceful waters far behind even the backwash of that
cataclysmic tidal wave in which so many less fortunate
millions had been sucked under.</p>

<p>My first job was to accompany a party of French
war correspondents to the occupied territory which
the enemy had recently been forced to evacuate,&mdash;Dunkerque,
Ostend, Bruges, Courtrai, Denain, Lille.
There one marvelled at the courage of those citizens
who for four years had had to bow the neck to the
invader. From their own mouths we heard stories of
the systematic, thought-out cruelty of the Germans who
hurt not only the bodies of their victims, but their self-respect,
their decency, their honour, their souls. How
they survived that interminable hopeless four years of
exaggerated brutality and pillage, cut off from all communication
with the outside world; fed with stories of ghastly
defeats inflicted upon their countrymen and allies, of
distrust and revolt between England and France; fined
and imprisoned for uncommitted offences against military
law, not infrequently shot in cold blood without trial;
their women submitted to the last indignities of the
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Inspection sanitaire</i>,” irrespective of age or class,
wrenched from their homes and deported into the
unknown interior, sent to work for the hated enemy
behind the firing line, unprotected from the assault of
any German soldier or officer,&mdash;for those women there
were worse things than the firing trenches.</p>

<p>We saw the results of the German Official Department<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
of Demobilization, which had its headquarters in Alsace-Lorraine
at Metz, under a General, by whose direct
orders all the factories in the occupied regions were dismantled
and sent back piecemeal to Germany, the shells
of the plant then being dynamited under pretence of
military necessity. We saw a country stripped of its
resources, gutted, sacked, rendered sterile.</p>

<p>What is the Kultur, the philosophy which not only
renders such conduct thinkable, but puts it into the most
thorough execution? Are we mad to think that such
people can be admitted into a League of Nations until
after hundreds of years of repentance and expiation in
sackcloth and ashes? They should be made the slaves
of Europe, the hewers of wood and drawers of water,
the road-sweepers and offal-burners, deprived of a voice
in their own government, without standing in the eyes of
all peoples.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>French General Headquarters, to which I was then
sent as liaison officer, was established in a little old-world
town, not far from Paris, whose walls had been battered
by the English centuries ago. Curious to think that
after hundreds of years of racial antagonism we should
at last have our eyes opened to the fact that our one-time
enemies have the same qualities of courage and
endurance, a far truer patriotism and a code of honour
which nothing can break. No longer do we think of
them as flippant and decadent. We know them for a
nation of big-hearted men, loyal to the death, of lion-like
courage, with the capacity for hanging on, which in
our pride we ascribed only to the British bull dog. We
have seen Verdun. We have stood side by side with them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
in mud and blood, in fat days and lean, and know it to be
true.</p>

<p>In this little town, where the bells chimed the swift
hours, and market day drew a concourse of peasant
women, we sat breathless at the ’phone, hourly marking
the map that liberated each time a little more of France.
Days of wild hope that the end was at hand, the end
which such a short time back had seemed so infinitely
remote, days when the future began to be a possibility,
that future which for four years one had not dared to
dream about. Will the rose colours ever come back?
Or will the memory of those million dead go down with
one to the grave?</p>

<p>The Armistice was signed. The guns had stopped.
For a breathless moment the world stood still. The
price was paid. The youth of England and France lay
upturned to the sky. Three thousand miles across the
ocean American mothers wept their unburied sons.
Did Germany shed tears of sorrow or rage?</p>

<p>The world travail was over, and even at that sacred
moment when humanity should have been purged of
all pettiness and meanness, should have bowed down in
humility and thankfulness, forces were astir to try and
raise up jealousy, hatred and enmity between England,
France and America.</p>

<p>Have we learnt <em>nothing</em>? Are these million dead in
vain? Are we to let the pendulum swing back to the
old rut of dishonest hypocritical self-seeking, disguised
under the title of that misunderstood word “patriotism?”
Have we not yet looked into the eyes of Truth and seen
ourselves as we are? Is all this talk of world peace and
league of nations mere newspaper cant, to disguise the
fear of being out-grabbed at the peace conference?
Shall we return to lying, hatred and all malice and re-crucify
Christ? What is the world travail for? To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
produce stillborn through our own negligence the hope
of Peace? The leopard cannot change his spots, you
say. My answer is that the leopard does not want to.
What does the present hold out to us who have been
through the Valley of the Shadow? What does it look
like to us who gaze down upon it from the pinnacle of
four years upon the edge of eternity?</p>

<p>Your old men shall see visions and your young men
shall dream dreams.</p>

<p>The vision of the old men has been realized. In the
orgy of effort for world domination they have dug up a
world unrest fertilized by the sightless faces of youth
upturned to the sky. Their working hypothesis was
false. The result is failure. They have destroyed themselves
also in the conflagration which they started. It
has burnt up the ancient fetishes, consumed their
shibboleths. Their day is done. They stand among the
still-smoking ruins, naked and very ugly.</p>

<p>The era of the young men has begun. Bent under
the Atlas-like burden loaded upon their shoulders, they
have stood daily for five years upon the edge of eternity.
They have stared across into the eyes of Truth, some
unrecognizing, others with disdain, but many there are
in whose returning faces is the dawn of wisdom. They
are coming back, the burden exchanged. On them rests
the fate of the unborn. Already their feet are set upon
the new way. But are they strong enough unaided to
keep the pendulum from swinging back? No. It is
too heavy. Every one of us must let ourselves hear the
new note in their voices, calling us to the recognition of
the ideal. For five years all the science, philosophy and
energy of mankind has been concentrated on the art
of dealing death. The young men ask that mankind
should now concentrate on the art of giving life. We
have proved the power within us because the routine of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
the world’s great sin has established this surprising
paradox, that we daily gave evidence of heroism, tolerance,
kindliness, brotherhood.</p>

<p>Shall we, like Peter who denied Christ, refuse to
recognize the greatness within ourselves? We found
truth while we practised war. Let us carry it to the
practice of peace.</p>
